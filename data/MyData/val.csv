1949736,U0,1949736_3,1.0,3,what is active transportation?,"Active transport is the movement of something against its gradient across a membrane (from areas of low concentration to areas of high concentration).  This process usually may involve a protein specific to the molecule that is being transported (such as carrier proteins) and it always involves energy of some kind, whether it be a membrane potential (the voltage difference across a membrane), ATP, GTP, etc."
1949736,Q0,1949736_5,1.0,5,what is active transportation?,active transport:. the movement of dissolved substances across a cell membrane that requires energy to move against the concentration gradient from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration
1949736,Q0,1949736_4,1.0,4,what is active transportation?,"prince ali have right.. example on what he said: is the transport of glucose from proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) in kidney.. this glucose if filtered from blood to urine since the pressure in blood is higher than it in glomerulus (where filtration occures in kidney) this type of transport is a passive transport, the glucose is absorbed from kidney tubules (PCT)by a transporter molecule and 1 atom of Na+ is filtered out (by Na+/Glucose Pump) this phenomenon is called couter transport since one molecule goes in and the other goes out to maintiin equilibrium, tyhis is an active transport exampl.. also Osmosis is a passive trasport. all transport phenomena that did not uses energy are so called passive transports.. also there is passive tranpost occuring with some bllod cemical carier proteins that conserves body energy, but all pasive transport carier transport only one molecule at a time.. while other active transport protein (need energy) transport more that 1 molecule at a time.. energy in the bodyis of many type:. -it's generated from high energy bond breakage, as ATP-> ADP+ P. Or GTP.. -another type of enrgy in the proton motive force eneregy. wich is generated by many protons (H+) and electrons that comes from NADH and FADH through Ubiquinon (Q). the difusion of (H+) through Pore of an active enzyme will be assembled as energy wich make some pumps active.. Just for notice: the way that water goes upward in a plant is not a transportation at all (neither active or passive) it's simply a cappilary action that may occures with water in any thin tube."

1949736,Q0,1949736_6,0.6666666666666666,6,what is active transportation?,"Active tranportation of water or any other substance in plants or animals is the transport against the potential gradient. This process, unlike passive transport, requires energy."
1949736,Q0,1949736_1,0.6666666666666666,1,what is active transportation?,WATER IS NOT MOVED BY ACTIVE TRANSPORT!!! Water is moved by Osmosis (diffusion of water molecules through a selectively permeable membrance DOWN a concentration gradient). Active Tansport requires Adenosine Tri-Phosphate or simply ATP molecules. Energy is used to move particles FROM area where they are in LOW concentration to area where they are HIGH in concentration. AGAINST a concentration gradient. USUALLY through a Transport Protien! active transport is AGAINST the Concentration gradient!
1949736,Q0,1949736_0,1.0,0,what is active transportation?,"Active transportation can also refer to substances that are carried into the brain across the blood-brain barrier. For example, glucose is actively transported into the brain. I think substances have to be actively transported to prevent harmful substances from entering the brain automatically. Drugs cross the blood-brain barrier because their chemical structure mimics that of substances that are supposed to be transported into the brain."
1949736,Q0,1949736_2,1.0,2,what is active transportation?,"Active transportation is any form of human-powered transportation. It is any trip made for the purposes of getting yourself, or others, to a particular destination - to work, to school, to the store or to visit friends. As long as it is ""active"", you can choose the mode - walking, cycling, wheeling, in-line skating, skateboarding, ice skating (eg. on a canal). Walking and cycling are the most popular forms of active transportation. It can also involve combining modes such as walking/cycling with public transit."
1949736,Q0,1949736_8,1.0,8,what is active transportation?,"A molecule requires active transport when its being accumulated against its electrochemical gradient, across some sort of membrane. This is usually coupled to another process which results in the release of free energy e.g. ATP hydrolysis or driven by a proton or sodium motive force. Typical examples include the accumulation of lactose by the proton symporter LacY across bacterial membranes."

Heat inside planets escapes towards their surfaces. For reasons that are not well understood, heat sometimes melts rocks, which then rise bouyantly toward the planet's surface. When the hot rocks - called magma - and included gases break through the crust, an eruption occurs. The buildup of ash and lava flows around the eruption hole (or vent) makes a volcano. Some volcanoes erupt for only a short time - a few days to weeks and never erupt again. Large volcanoes such as stratovolcanoes and shields erupt many thousands of times throughout their lifetimes of hundreds of thousands to a few million years."

196651,Q0,196651_2,1.0,2,What is the difference between customer and consumer?,"A customer is a human being, who customarily purchases a particular product, or service.. A consumer is merely a person, animal, or even machine that consumes any particular product, or service - without necessarily evincing a liking for it, or purchasing it.. For example, if you buy a tub of ice cream you are a customer. If you give it to child, who polishes it off, the child is a consumer. Similarly, a customer will buy a bundle of straw for a cow to consume. And an automobile will consume any brand of petrol purchased by its owner, who is the real customer.... Thus a customer turns into a consumer, only when he/she consumes the purchase. And a consumer turns customer, when he/she chooses a particular product or service, and buys it ! . ...But the sad part is that even persons who are actively involved in marketing and advertising confuse themselves [and others too !] by misusing both of these terms !"

376888,Q0,376888_9,1.0,9,How do you get rid of the smell of vomit in a car?,"Well, if in fact your car was vomitted in, rather than simply smelling like vomit, I would want to know the location of the incident in the vehicle.  If it was primarily in the seats, then what material are your seats?  If they are leather, you are going to need a good scented auto leather cleaner like Touch of Gold.  If the seats are cloth and/or the vomit ended up on the floor, then you will definitely need a heavy duty cleaner and disinfectant.  Lysol will certainly do the trick.  The key is to use as little water as possible, so that you aren't simply spreading it around.  Let it dry completely between cleanings... you should repeat 3 times.  The smell will probably still be there, so it will be a good idea to use carpet fresh just as you would the floors in your home.  Then top it all off with your favorite scent of car air freshener.... I recommend a Car Jar in the Macintosh scent.  you should probably leave your windows cracked during this process so all those smells have a chance to dissipate.. . I wouldn't use some of the harsh chemicals that other people are suggesting, simply because you may end up bleaching/fading/damaging your interior.  Everything I have told you is tried and true."

114758,U0,114758_0,1.0,0,Why does Christianity teach...?,"Don't forget that all homosexuals are devil-worshiping demons who shall be condemned to the bowels of hell. The whole concept of organized religion is so RIDICULOUS, that you just gotta laugh."
114758,Q0,114758_9,1.0,9,Why does Christianity teach...?,"Really Christianity teaches that?  I am very surprised.  . Yes you will burn in hell if you don't love him back.  Is that so hard to believe? Why is it so tough to believe?. Don't you see hell around you nowadays.  I'll give you a good hint...Open your news paper and see how many people have died today of gunshot wounds.   Ask individuals who suffered from the World Trade Center attacks, what it felt like during that time.  I'm sure none of them will tell you ""I was really happy, and it felt great yipeeee"".  They will probably tell you that they were in HELL! . . I don't believe Christianity teaches that sex is the most awful, filthy thing on earth and you should save it for someone you love.  Where in Christianity does it teach that?  Did you hear that in church or did you hear that from the mouth of Christ?"
114758,Q0,114758_8,1.0,8,Why does Christianity teach...?,"I can't speak for all of Christianity, but my church doesn't teach me this.. . The Church and the Bible does not teach that sex is vile, what it teaches is the sanctity of marriage, which in itself is the continuation of life.  Marriage was not always about love, rather about property and children.  Many marriages were arranged between families to enrich ones land or blood line.  Many royal families married other royalty to form alliances.  The church teaches sex should be within the confines of marriage, to protect the souls of those who are created out of the act.  Sex in this instance is an act of god.  Love is an entirely different entity.  Love is a human emotion not bounded by the dogma of christianity, nor controlled by it. . . As to the concept of heaven/hell, this can be traced throughout time.  Dante's Inferno is a great example of this.  The ancients believed in one place for both heaven and hell with different tiers to determine you eternal place...from the Elysian Fields of bliss to the torment souls who were forced to perform tasks until the end of time.  The most recent christian formation of hell can be traced back to the Spanish Inquistion and the rise of the anglican church in Europe.  . . In short, no this does not mean you can only have sex with god; but you should think about your actions and who will be hurt when you have sex."
114758,Q0,114758_3,0.3333333333333333,3,Why does Christianity teach...?,Religion as a whole teaches you just to believe what people tell you and never question it!

Do you feel superior by belittling someone else's belief?  Try reading the bible, with a open mind, and heart.  It may speak to you, you may have to actually change your life, you may have to love someone above yourself, so if you want to quote the work and Word of God, maybe just maybe reading it first would help you look less ignorant.. . Wow, let me see if I can take anything else in this sad world out of context, or written in another language and use it to misinform people.  Mr Slambango-try reading the verses directly before and after the ones you quote, try learning what the culturistic meaning would be by these sayings and events, of you tried actually studying who Jesus was and what it meant in the first scripture you quote, you would know why you sound so silly to anyone who does know Jesus as Savior.  You are actually telling the very reason being a Christian means having to let go of unbelievers sometimes, especially ones whose hearts are hardened.  It also is later referring to why I won't tell you that you are an idiot, slanderer, moronic or anything like that, Jesus came to fight my battle and guess what?  I win.. .

Hell is defined as being separated from God's presence.. . 2. The Bible says this about sex:. . Song of Solomon 4:3  Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.  (4)  Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.  (5)  Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.  (6)  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.  (7)  Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.  (8)  Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.. . Proverbs 5:18  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.  (19)  Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.. . 1 Corinthians 7:3  Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.  (4)  The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.  (5)  Do not deprive one another, except by mutual agreement, and that for a season, so that you may devote yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.. . and lastly...Hebrews 13:4  Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge."

He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."" Dangerous words from a guy who recommends cutting of body parts if they cause you to sin (Mt.5:29-30, Mt.18:8-9, Mk.9:43-48). It might make someone castrate himself so that he could be one of the 144,000 male virgins, who alone will make it to heaven (Rev.14:3-4). Matt 19:12 . . One of the followers of Jesus was a young, nearly naked man who dropped his linen cloth and ""fled from them naked"" when the priests came to arrest Jesus. Mark 14:51-52 . . In Romans, Paul explains that ""the natural use"" of women is to act as sexual objects for the pleasure of men. Rom 1:27 . Christianity teaches you to hate your entire family (Luke 14:26 KJV) . . On a lighter note.... . Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has ""come not to send peace, but a sword."" Matt 10:34-36 . . God said Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward. Matt 19:29. . Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children as required by Old Testament law. Mark 7:9-10 . . Jesus won't even let his followers bury their dead parents or say farewell to their families before abandoning them. Mark 9:59-62 . . Jesus recommends that to avoid sin we cut off our hands and pluck out our eyes. This advice is given immediately after he says that anyone who looks with lust at any women commits adultery. Matt 5:29-30 . . Jesus says that we should fear God since he has the power to kill us and then torture us forever in hell. Luke 12:5"

""Christians"" need to stop being a part of the problem suggetsed by this question."
114758,Q0,114758_13,0.6666666666666666,13,Why does Christianity teach...?,"What it happens is that God, the Almighty, is the beginning and the End of the Creation. But you have free will and if you choose to reject God, you only choose your final, and this rejection has not need to be explicit, it's like a father that has a rebel teenager that reject's everything the old man try to teach him, if the teenager grows and learn from his errors then he will say 'my old dad was right', and his miscarriage will be forgiven, but if he lost himself, and he end in jail, the father has nothing to do about.. . Sex is something that has to be taken with responsibility,. written is in Genesis 2,24. . Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. . . When sex has love and responsibility is wonderful, in another way is miscarriage, this has nothing to do with the bible, but with ethics."
114758,Q0,114758_12,1.0,12,Why does Christianity teach...?,"Your wrong. God loves you so much He gives you the choice to love Him or not. He could have made us slaves to him, but forced love is not true love, so He gave us a free will. All He wants is for us to love Him. He loved you so much He sacrificed His only son so we could be forgiven of our sins. It is sin that separates us from God, and also sin that gets us a ticket to hell. Therefore, if we chose to sin, then we chose to go to hell. God does not send us to hell, we do!.  Also, sex is a gift from God to husband and wife. We are the ones who make it dirty by fornication and promiscuity. If you don't believe me, think of it this way, sex in a monogamous relationship, ie husband and wife, rarely has bad problems, where as sex with different people over time is an extreme health risk with disease as well as unwanted pregnancy. As you can see, sex out of wedlock is a sin not because God doesn't want you to have fun or feel pleasure, but to keep you from getting Aids or having to get an abortion. Marriage is OK, you can have all the sex and pleasure you want."

If he's not neutered, you should get him neutered, although this will not DEFINATELY stop the problem, some fixed cats spray as well.

442495,U0,442495_0,1.0,0,How does perspective work?,"Close.  I would say it's because the photons from the object hit a smaller area of the cornea.  If you think of the surface of the cornea as a screen onto which the world in front of the viewer is projected through a lens, as an object is moved away the angle between its top and bottom gets smaller and so the relative size of the object in that projection gets smaller."
442495,Q0,442495_1,1.0,1,How does perspective work?,"The relative height of an object is directly proportional to the physical distance it is away from you.. . It has nothing to do with light, or your perception of it -- because if you were blind the object would still be smaller than if it were closer to you."
442495,Q0,442495_3,1.0,3,How does perspective work?,"This is a function of human beings having two eyes that are placed in the same plane. For instance, if you close one eye, and try picking up small objects, it is noticeably harder than if you tried to pick up the small objects using both eyes. . . Also, if you were to have eyes like a fish, one on each side of your head, you would not be able to tell perspective.. . The mathematical explanation for this is simple trigonometry. To explain it in non-mathematical terms, think of a line going from the center of your head (equally between your eyes) to the object. This line is the true distance to the object. . . However, your eyes are offset from this line. The distance from your eyes to the object is larger than the true distance from the center of your head. The amount of difference from the true distance to the distance to each eye changes depending on how far the object is away. . . If the object is very close, then distance from the eyes to the object is much greater than the actual distance. If the object is very far, than the distance from the eye to the object is very close to the actual distance.. . Your brain interprets this as depth."
442495,Q0,442495_2,1.0,2,How does perspective work?,"The first drawing on this site explains it best:. http://mathforum.org/sum95/math_and/perspective/perspect.html. . The size of the four line segments are the same, but they appear on the ""plane of the drawing"" to be different sizes, decreasing with distance.  Objects that are farther away create smaller angles with the eye, and so form smaller images on the plane of vision.. . (And if you knew the answer already, you should close out the question by selecting a best answer.)"

4047002,U0,4047002_5,1.0,5,What are liberal values?,"Liberal values stem around the idea that individual liberty is the primary political value. Essentually, each and every person has the same rights and liberties, and can live their life however they feal fit, including religion, sexuality, political association, as long as their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.. Because of the basic Liberal ideology that individuals can have free expression, values becomes a missnomer. For instance, conservitives consider family values to mean that families that consist of a mother, father, and children are correct, while other forms of family are some short or broken form of that valuable family. Liberals however consider family values to mean, any intimate relationship that values respect, love, honesty and providership.. A good liberal family could be a single mother, her best friend, and her 2 children, as long as the mother and friend love and respect the children, work to provide for eachother, and are honest and open.. Conservitives on the other hand would consider this family very broken, and dissfunctional."

I believe that the war in Iraq is unfounded, I believe in a couple's right to choose, and I believe that marriage is about love,  honor, respect and loyalty (not about gender). And I've never burned a flag. I don't do drugs, I pay my taxes, I volunteer with youth groups, and I'm not racist, sexist, or xenophobic. So... for all those people that say ""liberal values"" mean being immoral... they're sorely mistaken.. . I believe that everyone deserves equal grounds to stand on - quality affordable healthcare, a decent education, and the ability to access jobs within the American workforce without having to worry about being pink-slipped because a company has found cheaper labor outside of our country.

Of course, there are people that will say there was something before that. So what did that come out of? To explain this paradox, we define a creator as God. Sorry, all you religious fanatics, but God isn't just Christian, or Muslim, or Hindu. God doesn't even have a specific gender. As a collective whole we have made God into our image in an effort to understand ""Him,"" and I say him only because I don't want to say it, and don't have another word that would provide a conveyable description (although some people say ""the creator"" ). I accept that we can call this creator, God and to be able to talk amongst ourselves easily, I also accept saying him. However, I don't care if someone calls the creator Her, Fred, Your Royal Heinnie, whatever, because God is different to each individual. I don't think anyone fully understands God because if they did they probably wouldn't be human (so, it doesn't really make sense, but hopefully you get what I'm trying to say). God is our definition of creator of all things we don't understand, and we specifically like to say proof of god is verified by the beauty we see in such things as a baby's smile, the trees, and earth. Oh, and of course his sense of humor in the platypi (if that's a word)."

If we were brain gobblers from Mars we'd find the sky, the earth, and the trees to be darn scary and forboding, not to mention too hot.. . Also, consider this:  Why does God creating the universe preclude the notion that God uses evolution as a tool?   There is also this:  Who said God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day?  Somebody wrote that, did God bend that persons ear and say ""psst, hey buddy, I made all this in six days""  As for those people who believe the Earth is only 6000 years old, how do you have proof that it's any older than you yourself are?"

And the platypus is a significantly complex creature, though I won't go into all the reasons it probably didn't evolve to be this way right now.  Let's just say there are some pretty big flaws in the theory, which your science teach probably never told you."

Since this date there has always been about the pope a corps of Swiss Guards.. . They are responsible for the guarding of the sacred person of the pope and the protection of the Apostolic Palaces, all exits from the palace to the city and the entrance doors to the papal apartments being entrusted to their charge.

If women do cheat they are stoned to death, mutilated, or tossed out in the street and no one will help them.  Most women in countries like that commit suicide, most are very young.  This barbaric ritual is usually done to girls around the ages of 9-11 because that is about the time they are married off...usually to grungy old men who buy them for wives off the family.

It's like the tribes with the large plates in their mouths(women). Originally it was meant to make the women ulgy so  african and arabian slave traders would not kidnap them to sell as slaves or wives. That the men began to use it as a means of control and theoir own enslavement of females. And ove rthe years it has been so accepted in the tribes that most men will not marry a woman who has not had the plate inserted.  It's plain  male domination and incrimination of women at play,, nothing else.. People who  circumcise women do so to control her, degrade her, and make her disfigured so no one else will want her. in this manner a tribesman can have many wives to support him never fearing soemone else will want them from another tribe.. The shame is that most tribes women goes along with it as they were done so as children themselves.(much like muslim women are dominated, and degraded into believing it's the right thing to do) and as adults with little in life to enjoy they actually turn on their daughters tio d this ot ensure they will get a husband. and like I said they have the  dam nerve to call it culture. even mos tblacks here in america approve it for them.

4309174,Q0,4309174_10,1.0,10,What is the purpose of female circumcision?,"Circumcision is mutilation, and it is wrong, whether it happens to a girl or to a boy. In the countries where girls are mutilated and in many more countries where girls are not mutilated, they mutilate groups of dozens of boys, they all share the same rusty knife on the same filthy cot..AND NOBODY GIVES A DAMN.. because they think it is not so bad for a boy or they say there is some benefit to the boy for having it done. After fifty years of experience at being circumcised; my husband of thirty years knows there is no benefit to being circumcised, and he was circumcised in a hospital not in a vermin infested shack.. . Circumcision came about to remove as much pleasure from sex as possible, so people wouldn’t be so interested in sex all the time and be willing to spend more time working in the fields, or serving in the army, or worshiping G*d. If they removed anymore from a man, his glans for example, he would not function and he could not produce any offspring to man the army of the king or to work in his fields or to serve G*d. The female has only to receive the sperm to reproduce, so the removal of pleasure can be more extreme.. . Female mutilation is normally carried out by the older females of the clan; who, like their counterparts the circumcised males, often see themselves as being improved and this is something that must be done. The male children are mutilated by the circumcised adult males.. . These barbaric cruelties to children of either sex have no place in an enlightened world.. That what diminishes the least among us in the least way, diminishes me; for no man is an island, entire of itself...any man's torture diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the torturer calls; he calls for thee. .. . While female mutilation is physically more extreme, both are equally morally wrong. As long as mutilation is condoned in this country, who are we to tell the rest of the world . what they do is wrong?"

4456639,Q0,4456639_3,0.6666666666666666,3,"If evolution is true, then why are there still apes?","We did not evolve from monkeys.  People continually ask this question and I can't figure out why.  One of the first things you should have learned in school when taught evolution was that we share common ancestors to monkeys.  So they have evolved from that ancestor to what they are today, and so did humans."
4456639,Q0,4456639_11,0.6666666666666666,11,"If evolution is true, then why are there still apes?","When you think of species being eliminated, there has to be something selecting against them (for example competition from a similar-more highly evolved form out surviving them because of an ADAPTATION).  Lets make up an example to explain this to you.. . The nature of sexual reproduction is to create variation, and variation will be in either ""direction of a phenotype"" (a person who is 6'0 will have children who are 5'10, 6'0, and 6'2 for example).  This is the nature of inheritance.. . Now, lets hypothetically say that we were all at one time ""species X"".  The average member of species X can run 6mph.  Well, some members can run 9mph, and some can only run 3mph, again by nature of inheritance.  Well, if food were running short lets say, or any situation that ""selected"" for faster species members, everyone who ran LESS THAN 7mph would die, and those who ran GREATER than 7 MPH would survive.. . So now when this population of faster runners reproduces (7mph,8 mph, 9 mph), their offspring will run, again by nature of inheritance, maybe between 6mph - 12mph (as opposed to 3mph - 7mph).  Lets call this group now SPECIES Y.  . . Suddenly, perhaps more food is available, and speed is no longer a selective advantage.  Well, variation will continue to occur, but this time, slower members will not be selected against.  So, some will continue to be slower, and some will get faster.  The ones who get faster, are Species Z.  The ones who didnt get faster, remain Species Y.  But both have survived because nothing has selected against them!!!. . So looking at humans and their ""evolutionary predecessors"", remember that humans have slowly been removing themselves from any competition with apes.  Only this time don't look at speed, look at many many traits (intellience, walking on 2 legs, opposable thumbs, etc.)  We have been able to find our own food, and are involved in littlle competition with them for quite some time now.  . . When thinking about evolution, you must think BIG PICTURE.  That's how I always saw it.  You must think who is gaining SELECTIVE ADVANTAGES because of ADAPTATIONS FOR SURVIVAL, and who is going to be at SELECTIVE DISADVANTAGE based on COMPETITION AND LACK OF SURVIVAL."

I agree with you - the answer you have in mind could be (is probably) wrong.  As I don't know what it is, tho, I don't KNOW that it is.. .

4456639,Q0,4456639_14,1.0,14,"If evolution is true, then why are there still apes?","Because creatures evolve to fit into ecological niches.

4456639,Q0,4456639_9,1.0,9,"If evolution is true, then why are there still apes?","Because, like humans, the modern monkeys and apes also evolved from earlier monkeys and apes, but clearly not at different rates and in different directions. Why do different species of cat exist? Because they all evolved from earlier primitive cats. Lions did not evolve from tigers, did they? . . We may yet agree- there is only one right answer. . . I don't pretend to know how the universe or life originally began, although I have strong leanings toward certain theories. . But I know for certain, due to undeniable, hard reproducible evidence, that evolution - over millions of years - is a fact.. . Anything else is not supported by evidence, just faith."
4456639,Q0,4456639_8,0.6666666666666666,8,"If evolution is true, then why are there still apes?","If you are honestly looking for ""scientific proof"", I'm afraid that you have stepped on a rhetorical landmine.  You have had the misfortune of asking one of the many questions the Creationists ask several times a week, usually in with a bunch of other questions, for none of which they want answers.  The answer is simple.  Apes and humans descended from a proto-ape.  Most of the branches that descended from this ancient creature have come to an end, and even now, several great ape species are endangered.. . Your ""only one right answer"" statement set off a lot of alarm bells that suggested you were not interested in an answer, even if it was countered by your statement that your answer could be wrong.  Presupposing the answer is not very scientific.  Also, ""scientific proof"" triggers alarm bells.  Science has evidence, demonstrated hypotheses, and disproof, but no absolute proofs of anything.  The theory of gravity has less evidence, but then again, physics is simpler than biology.  I hope you understand that your question sounded a lot like the Creationist ""Evolution is stupid because if we evolved from apes..."" questions that fly around here several times a week."
4456639,Q0,4456639_4,0.3333333333333333,4,"If evolution is true, then why are there still apes?",apes probably evolved from a rodent or something.

57572,Q0,57572_2,1.0,2,how to stop sperm leak?,"Sperm leakage is a nartual occurance in a lot of men. Since I don't know what *kind* of sperm leakage you're specifically talking about lets address the two most common:. . Nocturnal emissions: A nocturnal emission, basically, is ejaculating in your sleep -which is common among teenagers and young adults, or any time after puberty. They are sometimes the result of erotic dreaming. But that's not always the case. One theory about why this happens is that your body is relieving itself of 'built up' sperm. Another holds that it is the result of very erotic dreams, or memories of waking sexual activity. Not every teenager or adult experiences this -although it is said that most males will experience a ""wet dream"" at least once in their post-pubescent lives. It is normal to experience.. . The other source is what I will call, the ""pre-drip"". This sometimes happens in guys while actively engaging in a sexual activity, more often than not, during foreplay. It is also known a ""precum"" -as some have dubbed it. Not unlike nocturnal emissions, it is the result of erotic excitement or in anticipation of sex, sexual acts, or anticipation of orgasm, penetration,  ejaculation or other psychosexual stimulus. It may also be a means for some males to produce lubricant before penetration. Not all men experience this ""pre-drip"". It is normal.. . In either scenario, ""leakage"" is perfectly normal and you really shouldn't worry about it. While it may seem somewhat embrassing (esp. if you're a teen and mom still cleans your sheets), it is not a sign that there is anything wrong with you.. . While you may be tempted to pursue voodoo-like ""natural"" remedies, there is no ""cure"" to speak of, except perhaps TIME. As you mature this will likely fade, if it doesn't, don't let that bother you. It's your body and you should be proud of its capabilities.. . Best of luck, man!"

3449078,U0,3449078_0,1.0,0,Why is the Church so scared of the Da Vinci Code?,"For the same reason it fears accepting gay marriage and the teaching of evolution - knowledge breeds discontent and books like the DaVinci Code, fictional or not, make people think.  The Church thrives on people NOT thinking, but following the leader instead.  If everyone begins thinking for themselves and realizes that religion is not necessary for a person to have real faith, the Church will lose its followers and begin to die.  Churches are businesses that depend on the money ""tithed"" by parishoners - essentially its a customer based business and if the customers no longer require the service provided, the business fails."

Not only the church but also christians should be concerned because the book has not only misrepresented the church as a murderous institution and that christian faith is utterly false. . . ""Brown writes about this mysterious and holy reality as if it were the Kiwanis Club with a somewhat longer and much nastier pedigree. Given how Catholics understand the Church, it was inevitable that his painfully false portrayal - despite its being fiction - would to be taken personally, for in a very profound way, it is personal.. . By way of analogy, imagine what your reaction would be if a novelist were to tell you, ""I am going to write a novel about your family, in which you will be portrayed as a band of criminals and perverts. I am going to use your real name and the names of your parents and grandparents. All the information regarding your family - a fair bit of which will, in fact, be true - will be presented as if it were the product of careful historical research. But - not to worry - it's only a novel, and afterwards I'll give you a chance to respond to the falsehoods in my book."". . Of course, our imaginary author has every right to publish his novel. The question to be raised here is another: would anyone with a sense of decency or responsibility write such a novel and then - when the novel is an international success that is taken far too seriously by many readers - make a movie of it? I find it hard to believe that this is the kind of thing that Sony and Dan Brown are eager to be seen doing."" -Fr. John Wauck"

There is absolutely no relation between geographic location and overall intelligence. Sometimes, in areas dominated by big, extended families (especially ones that intermarry), certain genes for intelligence (or lack thereof) tend to appear more often than others, and so residents of these areas are (again, stereotypically) labeled according to the general IQ trend.

People in the south don't have discrestionary money for higher learning and poverty runs in generations.  If grandfather is illiterate, he's not going to think that education is so important.  His child might get a basic education but that child will not have the same appreciation for education and might not make his or her child go to school when the child doesn't feel like it.

3506428,Q0,3506428_6,1.0,6,why is the sky blue in color?,"The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. . . However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. . . . .   As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white. . . Rayleigh scattering refers to the scattering of light off of the molecules of the air, and can be extended to scattering from particles up to about a tenth of the wavelength of the light. It is Rayleigh scattering off the molecules of the air which gives us the blue sky. Lord Rayleigh calculated the scattered intensity from dipole scatterers much smaller than the wavelength to be: . . . Rayleigh scattering can be considered to be elastic scattering since the photon energies of the scattered photons is not changed. Scattering in which the scattered photons have either a higher or lower photon energy is called Raman scattering. Usually this kind of scattering involves exciting some vibrational mode of the molecules, giving a lower scattered photon energy, or scattering off an excited vibrational state of a molecule which adds its vibrational energy to the incident photon. . . Why isn't the sky black?. Our sky is colored because our atmosphere makes blue light when sunlight passes through it. This phenomenon is called ""scattering."" It is similar to when sunbeams reveal themselves in the presence of dust, most spectacularly in cathedrals. The atmosphere causes the sky to be colored. . . .     .  If there were no atmosphere, the sky would appear black, like the lunar sky in Apollo pictures taken from the moon. But even a black sky has some lightness... Even at night, the sky always has a faint color, called ""skyglow"" by astronomers. Atmospheres also cause skyglow from faint airglow in the upper atmosphere (a permanent, low-grade aurora), and starlight scattered in the atmosphere. Even if there were no atmosphere, faint skyglow is caused by sunlight reflected off interplanetary dust (zodiacal light), and background light from faint, unresolved stars and nebulosity."

Gnosticism is a historical term for various mystical initiatory religions, sects and knowledge schools that were most active in the first few centuries A.D. around the Mediterranean and extending into central Asia.. . These systems typically recommend the pursuit of mysticism or ""special knowledge"" (gnosis) as the central goal of life. They also commonly depict creation as a mythological struggle between competing forces of light and dark, and posit a marked division between the material realm, typically depicted as under the governance of malevolent forces (such as the demiurge), and the higher spiritual realm from which it is divided, governed by God (the Monad) and the Aeons.. . As a result of these common traits, allegations of dualism, anticosmism and body-hatred are often raised against Gnosticism as a whole. In some applications, such charges may be justified.. . The terms 'Gnosticism' and 'Gnostic' are most properly applied to modern revivals of these groups. Recently their meanings have grown to include any religious movement incorporating a doctrine of special initiatory knowledge, which may lead to confusion.

4235520,Q0,4235520_9,1.0,9,"what is the meaning of the word ""gnostic""?","As early as the first century, Christianity was influenced by false religious teachings, causing Paul to warn Timothy to turn away “from the contradictions of the falsely called ‘knowledge.’” (1 Timothy 6:20, 21) This may have been a reference to a movement called Gnosticism that gained prominence early in the second century but that evidently got started in the first century, possibly with a certain Simon Magus. Some authorities claim that this may be the Simon mentioned in the Bible at Acts 8:9.. . Gnosticism got its name from the Greek word gno´sis, meaning “knowledge.” Gnostic groups contended that salvation is dependent upon special mystical knowledge of deep things unknown to ordinary Christians. They felt that possessing this knowledge enabled them to teach, as The Encyclopedia of Religion says, “the inner truth revealed by Jesus.”. The origins of Gnostic thought were many. From Babylon, Gnostics took the practice of attributing hidden meanings to Bible numbers, which supposedly revealed mystical truths. Gnostics also taught that whereas the spirit is good, all matter is inherently evil. “This is the same chain of reasoning,” says German author Karl Frick, “that was already found in Persian dualism and in the Far East in China’s ‘yin’ and ‘yang.’” The “Christianity” presented by Gnostic writings is definitely based on non-Christian sources. So how could it be “the inner truth revealed by Jesus”?. . Scholar R. E. O. White calls Gnosticism a combination of “philosophic speculation, superstition, semi-magical rites, and sometimes a fanatical and even obscene cultus.” . . Andrew M. Greeley of the University of Arizona says: “The Jesus of the Gnostics is sometimes incoherent, sometimes unintelligible, and sometimes more than a little creepy.”"

It usually refers to followers of Gnostic Christianity, with was the dominant form of Christianity practiced in the first three centuries CE.. . The specific knowledge they are talking about is the secret knowledge given by Christ to some of his disciples, including James, Judas, and Mariam. It is by this knowledge that man is able to transcend the confusion that we perceive as reality. The reason that reality is so messed up is that it was created not by the true God but by a demiurge or half-god called Yaldabaoth (aka Yahweh), who believed himself to be God and created man to worship him. The half-god's mother, Sophia, has made repeated attempts to undo her offspring's mistake by sending messengers to set us free. These came first in the form of a serpent, who told Eve about the Fruit of Knowledge, and then as the Logos (Christ) who preached about how to 'enter the Kingdom' until Yahweh had him crucified.. . 'Orthodox' Christians not only disagree with these ideas, but go totally apesh*t whenever they are mentioned.. . The best way to get a grasp of what Gnosticism is about is to watch 'The Matrix' or any other movie inspired by Phillip K. Dick, a self-described Gnostic.

The whole trial was basically a PR spin job (why do you think it was the Sunday before elections?)

Not that it will matter, it is kind of lame if you ask me when someone gets a death penalty from more than one jurisdiction... I mean you just got sentenced to death, do you really give a crap if you get sentenced to death again somewhere else?  In Sadam's case, it would simply give him a pulpit to spew more of his hatred."

Tell him to forget the bank and go to a local credit union.  Credit unions have less stringent requirements for such small loans; they would probably let him sign a note for an unsecured signature loan without requiring a co-signer.  Give him this advice and wish him luck, but don't let him guilt you into signing. You've already made the correct decision to not sign; you need to stick by your guns on this."

Proverbs 6:1, 2 says, ""My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, thou art snared with the sayings of thy mouth, thou art taken with the sayings of thy mouth"" (See verses 3-5).. . Proverbs 11:15 states: ""He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: And he that hateth suretyship is sure."" . . Many a man will do this for a friend long known and trusted; but no wise man will act for a stranger. Often, parents, will sign notes or loans with their children. There is a principle seen in these biblical words of wisdom. No one should cosign (guarantee) with another on any amount which possibly could fall back upon their responsibility to pay."

Be ready to witness him throwing a temper tantrum!!! It sounds like your buddy never grew up and still kicks and screams when he does not get his way.  You're actually helping him by forcing him to take ownership of his own responsabilites.  Your friendship will most likly cease after this, but remember, in the long run, you're being the best friend by letting him stand on his own two feet!!!"

By you co- signing for him you're saying that you will pick up the tab if he doesn't. You wont be driving the car, you're not married nor even relalted! Also if he needs a co- signer that means he either has no credit or bad credit which means he has had a history of not paying up to businesses, if he's not gong to pay to them what makes you think he's not gonna screw you? You def shouldn't do it, save your good credit for yourself and family in the future, you earned it, he didn't. And he knows that. He's probably just trying to take advantage of you. I think that it is so rude of your friend to even put you into a situation like this."

Say  you  will not co sign. get caller ID don't answer his calls. avoid him to no ends.. . He is just an acquaintance who happened to be a co-worker at one time not a friend.

In effect, that would create the same pH as a 0.4M solution of sodium hydroxide, for example."

If he gives you the pass, it will have the time you need to report back to post.  Don't be late.. . 1) If you have a buddy with connections, try to get a ride into town or wherever the group wants to go (within reason).. . 2) If you have no connections, hitch hike to town and go see the local sights.  (Ex. from Fort Dix you are within sightseeing distance of Atlantic City, NJ or NYC or Philly.  Independence Hall / liberty bell etc.. . 3) Join a community swim club and hang out with the locals.  It's a good way to get away from the Army for a while.. . 4) If all else fails, grab a book and get off post.  I used to walk a few miles to the community cemetery and lean against a handy tombstone while reading my book or just lay back in the grass and study cloud formations.. . The main thing here is to GET off the post!  If you hang around the barracks or goof off where the NCOs can see you, you are going to be placed on every weekend detail that arises.  Everybody else has a weekend off and you haul trash or sort clothes in a green building in the back of the area.  They'll also nab you if you come back to eat in the chow line.  Buy yourself a burger in town.. . Johnny"

There are lots of strange people out there, and they aren't all locked up.   Anyone who sends a fan letter to a serial killer probably should be locked up him/herself !!!"
114972,Q0,114972_1,1.0,1,Why are some women attracted to male death row killers?,"The ones that feel and do these things are as crazy as the killers themselves, as a woman myself, that is the only conclusion I can think of. Maybe some of these women can't get anyone else. Yuk!!!!!!!! Maybe they just want attention and these killers are the only ones that will give it to them."
114972,Q0,114972_3,1.0,3,Why are some women attracted to male death row killers?,"I think a huge part of it is women wanting to be able to ""Save"" someone. To be able to help in their most awful of times. To want to help someone. And want to understand that mind that could do something like that. And believe that all people can be loved and feel love.. . I personally chose enough jerks that are out of jail. I do not need to find them in the jail."

I've never heard of them being attracted to male death row killers, but hey anything is possible. They also think that since the guy is so reckless and daring, he can protect you in some way or another.

114972,Q0,114972_4,1.0,4,Why are some women attracted to male death row killers?,"The reasons are various and can be complicated.. . As stated above for some women it is that excitement of dating someone who is dangerous.. . For other women it is a lack of self-esteem and having a relationship with someone who is in prison means that there is an amount of 'control' that they have in that relationship. The man in prison is relying on them emotionally to help them do their time.. . Whatever the reason the letters sent between the prisoner and the partner can be extremely powerful, emotional, poignant and even sexual. They say absence makes the heart go fonder. I can see the reason why when there is a 20 ft prison wall (at least) between 'lovers'.. . How do I know this? I used to work as a prison psychologist!"

3236132,Q0,3236132_4,1.0,4,How do you know a prophet is real?,"In most countries people think that holy and inspired individuals receive orientation and instruction from God. Be it may these good and just persons, not all are prophets of God. Check out Numbers 11:29, 12:6, Exodus 33:11, Luke 2:70, and esp. Amos 3:7..  A prophet is a servant chosen by God, to supervise His family here on the Earth. He denounces sin and predicts its consequences. He is a promoter of righteousness. His primary purpose, however, is the bear testimony of Jesus Christ..  Since, the start of the world, in each era, God has revealed his plan of happiness through prophets to all people and families..  Apostasy means to reject the prophets of God the Father, and reject or distort the gospel of Jesus Christ. .  The Bible talks of both time when Earth´s inhabitants were guided by a prophet, and times also of apostasy. To end each period of apostasy, God calls another prophet to establish His kingdom once more on the Earth, giving the prophet the Priesthood, which is the authority to act in God´s name for the salvation of His Children..   Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and other ancient prophets, all of them taught the gospel of Christ. Unhappily, all of their times ended in apostasy.. .   We can´t know of spiritual truths, or if there be a prophet chosen of God in our time, without praying. But if he were here on this Earth living, he will also possess the same authority that Moses and the other prophets possessed before him..   Who is the only who knows for sure and cannot lie?(See James 1:5). James an apostle of the Lord wrote a letter to the early members of the Christ´s Church, telling them to whom they might ask in such times of uncertainty. Perhaps this will help you as well..   Pray that the Lord will lead you to His prophet. As we learned in Amos 3:7, God will ´do nothing´ save that he has called one of these servants. God is the same yesterday, today and always..   If called called prophets in ancient times, why would he not call one to establish his kingdom today?.   So, has God ceased to exist?.   Well, then maybe he doesn´t love us anymore?.   If we are living in days of great technological leaps and bounds, maybe we don´t need God anymore?.   I don´t know what you´d say, but I say - certainly not.. .   Pray in faith, with real intent, that your loving Heavenly Father will lead you to the truth that you seek."

Prophets were selected By God  and appointed with Holy Spirit.4.The things foretold  must come to pass  or   happen just as foretold  !00% of the time 5 .

No country.. . After the Jews it was a province of one or another external ruler- it was never indepenedent.

4232776,Q0,4232776_7,0.6666666666666666,7,what do jews base their claim to israel on?,"I see the same old lies given in answer to this question.. These are the facts. The Jews originally came from what is now Iraq. They were taken into slavery in Egypt.. They escaped from their slavery at a time when the Egyptian state was weak and spent 40 years as nomads in the desert where they worshipped idols as well as the god of Moses ( borrowed from Akhenaten). They eventually arrived at Mount Nebo in what is now Jordan where it is claimed that Moses was shown the promised land by his god.. If you stand on Mount Nebo today as I have done you will notice that the only land you can see is a small bit of the Jordan Valley and the northern end of the Dead Sea.. The land that they claim was already occupied by a thriving population both in the countryside and in cities. The only way they could take over was to kill the people who lived there ( remember Joshua and the Battle of Jericho).. It seems ""thou shalt not kill"" could be used very selectively.. The state of Israel in biblical times only lasted for two hundred years before it was overwhelmed by internal dissension and subsequent invaders such as the Romans.. Before the Zionists appeared on the scene in the 19th Century as a reaction to the persecution of jews in Europe, there were Jews living in the whole of the Middle East in harmony with the Arabs and other races for many centuries.. The Zionists changed all that with their distorted view of history and now we have the horrible mess as the Jews grab more land whenever possible and the Palestinians try to get back what was so recently theirs.. The Zionists triumphed after WW2 by acts of terrorism against the British controlling power, including the assassination of Lord Moyle in Cairo in 1944 , the destruction of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by a bomb delivered in a milk churn to the kitchens, the murder of British hostages and the terrorising of the arab population. They also invented the letter bomb, the first of which was sent to a S.A.S. officer in England killing his brother who opened it by mistake. Some of these terrorists such as Begin later became leading Israeli politicians.. So you could say that Israel is the first successful terrorist state.. As you will see it  has nothing to do with gods or historical rights , just who is better at killing."

And they sure have paid a high price for their allegiance to their heritage. Most of us would sell out our ancestors far more cheaply. Historically, the region that was known as Palestine during modern times was the land where the nation had a temple for worship and had occupied for hundreds of years (thousands?) until the latter part of the Roman empire. Even the moslem religion is taken from the religion of Abraham.

Especially if you could prove that your ancestors (who are themselves all dead) killed off all of the previous occupants when they first came upon the scene, and since these previous occupants left no descendants, there is no one left to challenge your claim to the land?  And suppose that wherever your people went to escape oppression, someone always wanted to kill them, or enslave them, or continue to oppress them somehow, so that when you got your land back, you and your people could be left alone to remake your own lives and be left to yourselves to re-form your own culture and your own government.

4232776,Q0,4232776_11,1.0,11,what do jews base their claim to israel on?,"Ahem...At any rate, it's a well-established historical fact disputed by virtually NO ONE that they existed in Israel for at least a thousand years (see Tel Dan Inscription, possibly 500ish years longer) before being driven out into exile.. They've essentially been refugees for 2000 years. Some might argue that after 2000 years, they've forfeited rights to the land. I think this is not based on any logical arguments, since no one could explain WHY this is equivalent to a forfeiting of the land.. Further, the reason we have no other people group to compare them to is that no other people group has ever survived without a home land for more than 200 years. (Interesting trivia.). . For the record, scholars that take the Bible with a grain of salt would insinuate that the Israelites were a NATIVE population that developed a body of myths to explain where they came from. IN this line of thinking, the Israelites have been in the land for much longer thn 1000 years, simply as an extension of natives.. . . . For the record, according to this argument, the Palestinians still have some claim to the land also, since it's been their homeland for the past 100 years of so. . Strangely enough, before that time the land had been virtually uninhabited for a period of time. Mark Twain noted that when he visited.... Hm. . Anyway. That's why the land was divided into 2 countries, one was called ""Jordan"" and the other was set aside to eventually become a Jewish state. Jordan was for the arab palestinians, and the other section was, obviously, for Jewish folks.. . I think this is where reasonable people really begin to debate. Was Jordan an acceptable homeland for the Palestinians? and a million other questions.. . . . -Stephen. . . P.S. Ancient Israel did not succesfully eliminate all previous inhabitants of the land, and further, more made the area their home while Israel occupied it. Philistines didn't get to Israel until after Israel was already there (prob. about 12th century B.C.). . . P.P.S. The claims about Mt. Nebo are patently inaccurate. Mt. Sinai (he says this is a reference to mt. Nebo in Jordan) is what the mountain is called in the Biblical writings, which are almost universally regarded as being in Sinai, not Jordan. Those who disagree (there are a few scholars who disagree, though not very many) place the mountain in Arabia."

Strawberries are among the top three fruits that pack this diesease-fighting punch.. . . . Science tells us that antioxidants are key to warding off chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer and to promoting optimum health. Researchers have tested foods to understand their antioxidant capacity. One test called Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity or ORAC for short showed that strawberries are packed with antioxidants, most notably anthocyanins, the pigment that makes strawberries red. The only problem, researchers warned, is that we don’t know if the antioxidants get into the body efficiently. . . Well, preliminary results from a study on strawberries conducted by Dr. Gene Spiller of the Sphera Foundation show that 30 minutes and 60 minutes after eating strawberries antioxidant levels in the body peak markedly. This reveals that the antioxidants in strawberries are efficiently absorbed. Once antioxidants are absorbed, they are able to fight free radicals—rogue compounds that wreak havoc on the body. . .

When he tries to convence other to embrace his/her religion he/she is achieving two goals:. 1- To think out loud and to see if his/her religion can really convence other people who are not biased by enviroenment.. 2- To feel that there are many people share his ideas, which means that those ideas are valid according to psychological rule that says the wider the idea is accepted the less doubt you have about it."

[1] Once the religious meme has parasitised the mind of its host, a religious meme needs to propagate itself. A successful meme will contain instructions for some or all of the following:. . [2] Holy war - convert or kill all unbelievers .. . [3] Intimidation & terrorism - threaten and discriminate against unbelievers.. . [4] Enforced social isolation or even death to apostates. (An apostate is a host which has cured itself of a meme-infection. Apostasy within the community of believers is especially dangerous to the meme because it might encourage meme-resistance in others).. . [5] Fecundism - encourage true believers to breed faster than believers in false memes.. . [6] Censorship - prevent rival memes from reaching potential hosts (a theological doctrine known as 'Error has no rights').. . [7] Disinformation - spread lies about rival memes.

886153,Q0,886153_5,1.0,5,Why do we want our relegion to be accepted and the only way out?,I don't think that it is about my religion being accepted.There are several different religions.However God being accepted is a different story.I am baptist.It doesn't matter to me what denomination you are as long as God gets all the praise and glory He deserves.A-lot of people criticize believers of trying to cram things down their throats.It's like this:if you found something good or something helpful to you at the store you would want to share it with others.This is the same when you find God.You have found something Great and Awesome in power and you want to share it with others.I pray for those who don't know God.

886153,Q0,886153_1,1.0,1,Why do we want our relegion to be accepted and the only way out?,"I think anytime we believe in something that brings us joy we want others to share that same joy, and religion is like that for people. When they find something that makes them feel good and changes their lives they think that others should believe it too. But we have human rights to decide what we want to believe and in who. But I think its just the joy people feel when they find something they want to share it with other, which means trying to convert them. It not that bad, if you do not want to be converted you just say no. A real Christian  ( or maybe any other religions) should know that you should not judge another for their choices in life. I can say that what I believe and that its the best but if you say no, my job is done."

My God is truth, or My ideals are just, or reconcilation only comes from this or that or so on. Religion is based on a system of moral codes and culture that a group has to agree on. Since there are so many different ways to approach a religion with the stories and teachings and on and on, it becomes easy to see why there are so many ways to get to religion. Still, it poses the question, are my absolutes right if everyone elses are. This is especially a problem if other religions promote things that seem contradictory to what you believe. Therefore many religions provide inclusion and exclusion standards to provide a sense of comfort to their believers - to make sure they are sure they have it right."

They seem to be giving less attention to providing tested and proven support to the troops and focusing more on stupid and overambitious ideas like robot planes and lasers. Thats where the US taxpayer's military money is spent folks...crazy/junk projects not troops and reliable equipment."

Even when you have some experience in a similar job that's often not good enough for them! Voluntary work is one way of getting experience, but it depends what kind of work you want..

I was fortunate because my dad hooked me up with a firm of solicitors because he knew the boss, that's how I got my experience and the same goes for others that I know, they gained experience through contacts. I would suggest:. . 1. You try and speak to friends and relatives that may be able to help you out, sometimes it's who you know and not what you know. . 2. Bombard companies with your CV, just blitz every place you can think of with your application, if you don't try you don't know!. . 3. Offer your services on a voluntary basis, I know working for no money is a pain but at least you will have something on your CV by way of experience and it is more likely to get you a paid job quick as opposed to constant failed applications. Always remember that experience is the key, employers always look for this because the less they have to train you the better it is for them. . . You don't specify what sort of work you're looking for but I'm sure the above approaches are applicable. . .

Turn the question on its head and ask how they can expect a school-leaver to have experience. More seriously, find out why they are using that excuse. Look smart, sound confident and be enthusiastic about getting a career in the field you have chosen. And don't take rejection personally. Getting a job is a numbers game. Paper your wall with rejection letters and try all of the very wise tricks in the other answers. You are worth something. Don't let rejection grind you down.  Good luck with your career."

On the other hand some hard core Confederates didn't want the abolition of slavery, and had they had there way America as we know it could have turned out much differently to say the least.

Most people just think of it as part of their heritage, and as a symbol of independence, believe it or not.  Contrary to popular belief, the secession of the South was not about race.

The Civil War was about succession from the Union. . . Whenever the Confederate flag gets flown, it is symbolic of the unity of the South. Which is a bogus theory. The South is no more unified now than it was during the Civil War. The south no longer exports its' racism or it's history with slavery, but it exports its' stupidity and backwards values.. .

3653952,Q0,3653952_34,1.0,34,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"SO many of the answers here show people's complete ignorance.  The insinuation that the confederate flag is a symbol of slavery is preposterous.  I won't go into the details of why, because that is not what your question is about.  I think that your question is completely valid and neither rude nor ignorant.  During Reconstruction, display of the flag was illegal in states occupied by federal troops.  I believe that people fly the flag today for the same reason that people display their family crest, or tartan.  As for being afraid, I think that's understandable.  It sounds as though you are coming from a totally different frame of reference, and that's ok.  There is a certain stigma surrounding the Confederate Flag, but ultimately, I think we should respect each others' differences and not look down on someone because they know and care where they came from.  People joke about the Civil War all the time, and I think to a certain degree it burns Southerners more, but of course it would, they got their asses handed to them.  So can't we be a wee bit gracious and allow them to fly a flag to honor the men and boys that died without calling them names?  If the answer is no then you are more ignorant than any redneck, hick or hillbilly I've ever met.  Tolerance, remember?  Even if you don't agree.  And just for the record there were people in the North who didn't want slavery abolished either.  Good ol' Abe himself just wanted to ship every black person back to Africa, and the Union, after the war, turned black men only into second-class citizens.  Wake up people, racism wasn't limited to below the Mason-Dixon line."

I figure that rednecks can drop the confederate flag when blacks drop black power flags, hispanics drop mexican flags, and gays drop rainbow flags.. . The next time you see a confederate flag, instead think of how stupid we are as Americans.  Where in the heck does it even say anything about seperation of church and state in the constitution?  Look it up people.  It was in a letter..... after the fact."
3653952,Q0,3653952_17,1.0,17,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"A man on our street says it is because he is from Georgia.  . . I acually feel like the confederate flag is a symbol that represents those individuals who became traitors against the United States.  After all, what else was it but treason?"
3653952,Q0,3653952_16,0.6666666666666666,16,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,the confederate flag was one of the battle flags in the south. It has nothing to do with people being African American. If you looking into the history of the flag there was most likely there were some African American men that fought underneath that flag. Why should we be afraid of flag when we have people trying to change our national anthem or try taking God out of our schools and our government. When they come here for freedom to have the right to their own religion and lifestyles without bias or judgment. Some people want to keep up with history and traditions. Why should we judge that.
3653952,Q0,3653952_28,0.6666666666666666,28,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"I think flying the Confederate flag says one thing: ""I consider myself a Confederate. An American, but a resident of the south, and my southern heritage is what matters most to me"". I don't think these people realize that the men who fought for the Confederacy committed treason. Had we lost the American Revolution, not only would America not exist as we know it, but the founders we admire would've been tried for treason. They all would have hung from ropes for saying the things they said. We won, but 90 years later a group of Americans decided to change the country again. They seceded from the Union, formed their own nation, with their own president, and fought us hand to hand on American soil. In the end, America came out on top. The Confederate flag has nothing to do with slavery. It's not about ""white pride"" or ""southern pride"", it's about a Nation, a nation that no longer exists. Do any other countries continue to fly the flag they used before a revolution (it's a legit question, I honestly don't know)? I don't THINK they do. Lincoln could've tried every souther general, the President of the Confederacy, and countless othere ""Confederates"" with treason. By American law, they all could've been hanged. He didn't. Lincoln pardoned every one, allowing them to live. How did the south thank him? By placing their OLD flag on every bumper sticker, notebook, baseball cap and hanging it on every flagpole they can get their hands on. I am all for free speech, but I think the past needs to be put to rest. I don't agree with immigrants pleading for civil rights, while waving their home flags. I am all for heritage, but there is a limit."
3653952,Q0,3653952_29,1.0,29,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,I think it's an ignorant way for the south to say that they have their own culture apart from the rest of the country. It's turned into more a racist flag than anything else. Kinda like the Conch Republic flag in Key West feels that they are separate from Florida. Most of the time it's people that lack common sense enough to realize that we are the UNITED States of America or lack the intelligence enough to even be able to read a history book to research the flag.
3653952,Q0,3653952_25,1.0,25,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,I think its mostly a southern pride / good ol' boy symbol. But I think many of its owners are oblivious to the feelings it stirs up in others.

3653952,Q0,3653952_38,1.0,38,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"It is more from a sense of Southern pride now than anything else. Many in the south feel that the war and the reasons for it have unfairly prejudiced the nation against us and it is a way to show that we still have a sense of honor and pride that cannot be taken away. One thing that it is important to know and people should always remember is that only around 2% of the people in the south before the civil war owned slaves .... most were simple share croppers and the like who were often no better than slaves themselves in many ways. It was never really the ""southerners"" that caused slavery .. it was, just like now, the rich man that was the root of the evil."
3653952,Q0,3653952_42,1.0,42,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,Probably for the same reason people who's heritage is from another country waves that flag.

Anyway just to let you know, here in Mississippi, some blacks even sport the flag on their front porch. I know lots of blacks who were cotten tshirts and confederate shirts. It has nothing to do with racists and not every one in the south is a redneck, you moron. Although I will say that lots of people in the south ARE racists. Blacks hate whites and whites hate blacks, that my friend, is a fact. Just live in Mississippi a MONTH, you will see. Its terrible but the flag DOES NOT represent racism or soar losing. Its heritage."
3653952,Q0,3653952_24,1.0,24,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"I get scared sometimes as a white person, The confederate flag as a symbol was created to symbolize the fact that the south wanted to segregate itself from the USA.  Not that I think that you need to be a patriotic nut job and not be proud of your roots, but if the government wants to look for groups of people who are most likely to try to overthrow our government, wouldn't it be the people who after so many years still carry there symbol and wave their symbol of resentment towards the United states.  I bet these same people have a problem with immigration, but they are ok waving their anti-patriotic flags around.  It is a scary thought."
3653952,Q0,3653952_15,0.6666666666666666,15,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"We're just proud to be southern.To be honest the civil war was based on money at first,then came the freedom of slaves.I'm glad that slavery got abolished,because Ive got some really good friends that are black.One even gots a tattoo of the Confederate flag on his right arm.Slavery still exist in this world and I think that should be a bigger issue than a flag."
3653952,Q0,3653952_26,1.0,26,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"To me (a self-proclaimed red-neck, although a yankee born and bred)  the confederate flag is the symbol of people who were willing to fight and die for what they believed in.  At the time, they fought to protect their livelihood and their way of life.  It may not have been right, but at the time, that was all they knew.. . If people didn't take a chance or go out on a limb to fight for what they believe in, the history of the world would be way different than what we know.  If people didn't fight religious persecution, the US would never have been founded.  At least not the way we know it.  If we hadn't fought the British, the US would now be a British colony and we would all drink tea instead of coffee.  What if women hadn't fought for equal rights?  . .  There is a need for people to stand up for what they believe is right.  Even if they are judges to be wrong.. . Why would you get scared?  Has anyone ever threatened you with a flag?  If you are scared of what you view as racism?  Ignorance?  Racism and ignorance carry no flag.  They waves no banner.  There is no warning.  Racism and ignorance can hide in the most surprising of places and pop out when you least expect it."

Now, in my town most of the people who have the flags don't even realize what it means.  And the ones who do should be shipped away to a deserted island.  I am sorry for all of the people that live in the south like myself that still have to put up with ""hillbilly"" ignorance."
3653952,Q0,3653952_20,1.0,20,Why do people still wave the confederate flag?,"I would not be against someone who waves the confederate flag.. But it has nothing to do with race.. Most people think of the civil war as being about slavery, but the south didn't see it that way.  They saw it as being about the rights of each state to make their own laws.  The laws just happened to be about slavery.  The north took the position that the federal government could make laws affecting the whole nation, while the south said that each state must decide for themselves.. So if you look at modern day issues, like, for example, abortion, then the souths position would be that each state would have to decide if they want to legalize abortion, but the north would say that the US congress would decide for everyone.. So people who wave the confederate flag are usually saying that they support ""states rights"".. But a lot of times, if someone who is african american makes a fuss over it, then those people will start making racist comments just to pick on you.  You really don't have anything to worry about."

Slavery is not the only thing the flag represents. It also represents southern culture and morals. Now and days we are so hypersensitive about stuff, its like saying if was in a car accident no one should drive cars anymore it ridiculus. The only thing that matters here is that we correct are mistakes and no repeat them and to me the confederate flag does that."

If you know any Arabs they might tell you that they are still taught their lineage when they are young children. This makes them half-brother with the Jews. They have been jealous ever since because Israel got the birthright and God's promises. So 635 years after the death of Jesus Muhammad invented allah and the Koran was written giving the Arabs preference.

98662,Q0,98662_8,1.0,8,how can you tell if you have a bad keg?,"If you get a bad keg, that's rare... it's probably a problem with the keg itself, not the beer. You CANNOT get a skunked keg of beer, but the batch may be off.. . Beer skunks because of a reaction to light; beer in green bottles and clear bottles will skunk faster than beer in brown bottles. When beer fills a keg, it does not have enough time to skunk outside of the brewing keg. Ergo, it cannot skunk. But it could be a batch that's gone off because of age, or because it's been tapped and retapped incorrectly. If this is the case, then the place you got it is kind of sketchy. They shouldn't be selling ""used"" kegs. . . If you really think that you have a bad keg, don't drink it, 'cause, well, ew, but bring it back. If they give you a problem with it, don't let them; they can turn it back into the distributor for a full refund, so they shouldn't have a problem helping you out. They probably won't issue you a refund, but you may be able to change out the keg.. . Just don't try it if you've had more than a quarter of the keg; if they can feel the difference in weight, they're going to laugh you out of the store. If you go out for dinner and don't like your meal but you eat it, you're not going to get any sympathy."
3465597,U0,3465597_0,1.0,0,how come some bibles translations dont use the original yahwey (jehova) in reference to god?,":}. Because they are translations, which means they change the words of the original language into the language they are translation to"
3465597,Q0,3465597_3,1.0,3,how come some bibles translations dont use the original yahwey (jehova) in reference to god?,"Excellent question! I couldn't find any reliable source to answer, so I only have mildly plausible theories to offer.  As others said, the Tetragrammaton (YHWH, Yahweh) is the forbidden name of God. The name cannot be said aloud, except by the High Priest on one special occasion; indeed, no one is sure how it should be pronounced. Also, it is only one of many names of God. . . So, early Christian theologians may not have used the name prominently because:. (a) as a Jewish sect, the taboo was still very strong against that name, in both the mind of the writers and the followers. . (b) Christian theologians may have wanted to differentiate the cult from mainstream Judaism by not mentioning any name of God at all, but simply calling him 'Lord' or 'Father'. Especially if Jesus didn't use the name himself (taboo!). I know no Ancient Greek to read the originals, so this is purely speculative.. . (c) The New Testament was written in Greek; YHWH has many layers of meaning in Hebrew, but none in Greek. Early Christians may have simply disfavoured the name, since 'Lord' was more meaningful.. . The name Jehovah *does* appear a few times in King James translation of the old Testament, so I suppose (a) and maybe (b) are the causes, and (c) is the main reason: the name fell out of use because there was no tradition of using it."
3465597,Q0,3465597_2,1.0,2,how come some bibles translations dont use the original yahwey (jehova) in reference to god?,"It probably depends on who is doing the translation.  In Jewish translations, where the name of God is never pronounced, it would simply be written as ""God"".  There are a few reasons for this. . 1) Jews try to avoid accidently using the name of God incorrectly. 2)  The name of God is never pronounced- in temple times it was pronounced by the High Priest, after an extensive purification ritual, during the service for the day of atonement.  This was the ONLY time it was pronounced.. 3) Hebrew is written without vowels.  Now the problem comes- how should it be pronounced/punctuated?  In temple days they would have had the yearly pronouncement to know this (and the pronouncement was overseen by seniour priests who knew exactly what it should be).  The problem is, that it was never recorded with vowels, and today nobody knows the correct pronunciation.  So, the issue is, how do you punctuate the name made up of the four letters ""Yed Hey Vav Hey""?  We don't know.  How do you then transliterate it?  No idea- so therefore, we cannot render it into a translation since it is impossible to translate the word.  (When reciting prayers another word, Adonai, is used, and most hebrew transliterations follow this tradition as it allows the user to follow the service.)"

3465597,Q0,3465597_5,1.0,5,how come some bibles translations dont use the original yahwey (jehova) in reference to god?,"Because the name ""yahweh"" was supposed to be so holy that it was not supposed to be spoken or written except by the very purest of people.  If you look in the back of most bibles, a reference or glossary, you usually will find the name.  Some religions also believe that only those who know the true name of God, ""Yahweh"" will be admitted into heaven and therefore it is a conspiracy to not use it."

631188,Q0,631188_7,1.0,7,"Why ""Break a leg""  means good luck?","It's unlucky to wish good luck upon an actor or a production. Instead, one should invite disaster; the phrase ""Break a leg!"" is most commonly used. As with many theatrical superstitions, there are multiple histories. The specific origin of this is unknown. . In the Shakespearean era, if one performed poorly, they would be booed and heckled off-stage, unable to complete the show. If their performance went well, however, they would finish the show, and take a bow. The bow involved a bent knee, creating a ""break"" in the leg. . It may be a relic of a more general superstition against wishing someone good luck. In ""the olden days"" people believed that there were mischievous sprites around, and so to stop the sprites from having the opposite effect (bad luck) one would wish the actor the opposite - a superstitious reverse psychology. . The phrase ""Break a leg!"" may date to Vaudeville days. As the story goes, more actors would be in attendance than were actually necessary. An actor needed to actually appear on stage to be paid, thus ""breaking a leg"" is to appear on stage, and therefore get paid. (A leg is a type of theatrical masking that hides the wings of the stage). The phrase probably would have moved into the mainstream through the 1920's and 30's movie industry. . Another idea or origin is that, being nervous, an actor's muscles or legs could cramp up, and one could overheat in the costume during a show. In that case, break a leg meant something along the likes of ""loosen up, and enjoy the show!"""

631188,Q0,631188_2,0.6666666666666666,2,"Why ""Break a leg""  means good luck?","Break a leg is a well-known saying in theatre which means ""good luck"". It is typically said to actors before they go out onto the stage to perform.. . It is a theatre superstition that the phrase ""good luck"" is actually bad, so ""break a leg"" is preferred in this situation. The expression may also be used outside the theatre, in everyday use, to mean ""good luck"".. . [edit]. Origins of the term. The origins of the term are hotly debated, and its true origin is unknown. Breaking one's leg is certainly not a good thing to hope for - therefore perhaps by some superstition, if the ""good luck"" causes bad, then perhaps the perceived bad luck of breaking one's leg causes good.. . However, the most commonly perceived true meaning of ""break a leg"" is the wish for many curtain calls. When you bow or curtsy, you are supposed to put one foot behind the other and bend at the knee, ""breaking"" the leg.. . Other theories suggest that the words ""break"" or ""leg"" are not used in their literal sense. For example, some have suggested that ""break"" refers to the act of breaking out onto the stage, or that the ""leg"" refers to the legs of the audience's seats.. . Another theory suggests that the term ""break a leg"" is actually an abbreviation for the phrase ""break a legend"", which roughly means ""go get yourself out there""!. . It could be a reference to the wooden legs in old curtains. If a cast were to have many encores, the curtain would be lifted and dropped untill the legs broke.. . Yet another theory is that it is be a translation from the German phrase ""Hals- und Beinbruch"" (""Break your neck and leg""), which comes from the Yiddish phrase ""Hasloche un Broche"" (""success and mercy"").. . It has also been peculiarly suggested that the origin of the phrase dates back to Shakespearean days. Apparently at the time, the poor and uneducated (often slow and dimwitted, and referred to as Groundlings) unable to afford real seats, would crowd the front of the theatre, right up against the stage. Transfixed by the performance, when they got really excited the Groundlings were customarily known to drool! Prior to their performance (on a stage besieged by eager Groundlings), actors would wish each other good luck by saying, ""May you give such a stirring performance that you fall on the ensuing spit of drooling groundlings, and break a leg!"""
631188,Q0,631188_11,1.0,11,"Why ""Break a leg""  means good luck?","Theatrical types are well-known for their belief in superstitions, or at least for their willingness to make a show of pretending to believe them. The term 'break a leg' appears to come from the belief that one ought not to utter the words 'good luck' to an actor. By wishing someone bad luck, it is supposed that the opposite will occur. Other superstitions are that is is bad luck to whistle in a theatre, to say the final line of a play during dress rehearsal, or to say the name of 'the Scottish Play' in a theatre's green room. . . The word 'break' has many meanings - the OED lists 57 distinct uses of it as a verb alone. That gives considerable scope for speculation over what is meant by the phrase. The most common interpretation of 'break' in this context is, 'to deviate from a straight line', as in the cricketing term, 'off break'. That is, unstraighten the leg by bending at the knee, by bowing or curtseying. . . 'Break a leg' also means, 'make a strenuous effort'. There are many references to the phrase used that way, which pre-date the earliest theatrical good luck charm meaning. For example, from The Hammond Times, Indiana, 1942:. . ""Whatever the army or navy want, the Continental Roll [and Steel Foundry] will turn out ... Or break a leg trying."". . From the Evening State Journal, Nebraska, 1937:. . ""With all the break-a-leg dancing there are many who still warm to graceful soft shoe stepping."". . So, it is possible that when an actor is told to 'break a leg', he/she may just be being exhorted to put on an energetic, exciting performance.. . There are many other possible derivations in circulation, mostly referring to the 'good luck' message. In diminishing order of plausibility, 'break a leg' these are:. . Put on a performance good enough that you will have to bend your knee in a bow or curtsey to acknowledge the applause. . Impress the audience so much that you will need to bend down to pick up the coins they throw onto the stage. . Pass out onto the stage to receive a curtain call (the side curtains on a stage are known as legs). . Go on stage and have your 'big break'. . Evoke the powers of the celebrated actress Sarah Bernhardt, who had one leg. . A reference to John Wilkes Booth, who broke his leg when jumping on stage, attempting to flee after shooting President Lincoln. . It is tempting to believe the phrase to be ancient and to imagine it whispered to Tudor minstrels as they went on stage at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. There was an earlier meaning of 'break a leg' of that vintage (1670), which was 'to give birth to a bastard'. This is now entirely out of use and is not related to the theatrical version. The current meaning is nothing like as old. The term originates in the American theatre in the 20th century and all the earliest references to its use are from US sources. The earliest citation we can find in print is from as late as 1948, from an edition of the US newspaper, the Charleston Gazette, in May that year. This is from their 'Ask The Gazette' column:. . Q. What are some of the well-known superstitions of the theatre?. A. Superstitions of the stage are numerous and many are particular to individual actors and actresses. That it is bad luck to whistle in a dressing room is a widely accepted belief. Another is that one actor should not wish another good luck before a performance but say instead 'I hope you break a leg.'. . That pretty much rules out the Sarah Bernhardt and John Wilkes Booth interpretations which, as well as being rather fanciful, date from too far before any printed version. . . There is a German saying, 'Hals und Beinbruch', meaning 'break your neck and leg', which dates back to at least WWII, as Luftwaffe slang, and is therefore earlier than any known English version. It may be that this is a corruption of the "

4186521,Q0,4186521_14,0.0,14,Why are there Atheists?,"The generally accepted age for the Earth and the rest of the solar system is about 4.55 billion years (plus or minus about 1%). This value is derived from several different lines of evidence.. . Unfortunately, the age cannot be computed directly from material that is solely from the Earth. There is evidence that energy from the Earth's accumulation caused the surface to be molten. Further, the processes of erosion and crustal recycling have apparently destroyed all of the earliest surface.. . The oldest rocks which have been found so far (on the Earth) date to about 3.8 to 3.9 billion years ago (by several radiometric dating methods). Some of these rocks are sedimentary, and include minerals which are themselves as old as 4.1 to 4.2 billion years. Rocks of this age are relatively rare, however rocks that are at least 3.5 billion years in age have been found on North America, Greenland, Australia, Africa, and Asia.. . While these values do not compute an age for the Earth, they do establish a lower limit (the Earth must be at least as old as any formation on it). This lower limit is at least concordant with the independently derived figure of 4.55 billion years for the Earth's actual age.. . The most direct means for calculating the Earth's age is a Pb/Pb isochron age, derived from samples of the Earth and meteorites. This involves measurement of three isotopes of lead (Pb-206, Pb-207, and either Pb-208 or Pb-204). A plot is constructed of Pb-206/Pb-204 versus Pb-207/Pb-204.. . If the solar system formed from a common pool of matter, which was uniformly distributed in terms of Pb isotope ratios, then the initial plots for all objects from that pool of matter would fall on a single point.. . Over time, the amounts of Pb-206 and Pb-207 will change in some samples, as these isotopes are decay end-products of uranium decay (U-238 decays to Pb-206, and U-235 decays to Pb-207). This causes the data points to separate from each other. The higher the uranium-to-lead ratio of a rock, the more the Pb-206/Pb-204 and Pb-207/Pb-204 values will change with time.. . If the source of the solar system was also uniformly distributed with respect to uranium isotope ratios, then the data points will always fall on a single line. And from the slope of the line we can compute the amount of time which has passed since the pool of matter became separated into individual objects. See the Isochron Dating FAQ or Faure (1986, chapter 18) for technical detail.. . A young-Earther would object to all of the ""assumptions"" listed above. However, the test for these assumptions is the plot of the data itself. The actual underlying assumption is that, if those requirements have not been met, there is no reason for the data points to fall on a line.. . The resulting plot has data points for each of five meteorites that contain varying levels of uranium, a single data point for all meteorites that do not, and one (solid circle) data point for modern terrestrial sediments. It looks like this:. . . Pb-Pb isochron of terrestrial and meteorite samples.. After Murthy and Patterson (1962) and York and Farquhar (1972) .. Scanned from Dalrymple (1986) with permission.  . . Most of the other measurements for the age of the Earth rest upon calculating an age for the solar system by dating objects which are expected to have formed with the planets but are not geologically active (and therefore cannot erase evidence of their formation), such as meteorites. Below is a table of radiometric ages derived from groups of meteorites:. . . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------.  . Type Number.

3555750,Q0,3555750_6,1.0,6,Why is the earth's core hot?,"About 4-billion years ago, when Earth was in the final stages of forming, it was one immense sphere of molten material. Over time, Earth began to cool from the surface inward. At the same time, the planet's heaviest elements sunk towards the still molten core; some of those elements were radioactive. Today, Earth's mostly-molten core has a high temperature for two main reasons: (1)radioactivity; (2)pressure of all the material squeezing inward against it."
3555750,Q0,3555750_7,0.0,7,Why is the earth's core hot?,Yes
3555750,Q0,3555750_4,1.0,4,Why is the earth's core hot?,The U.S. Geological office is in Rolla Missouri.  We also have University of Missouri Rolla.. . My best guess is the weight of the Earth creates pressure that results in heat.
3555750,Q0,3555750_5,1.0,5,Why is the earth's core hot?,"Looking at the answers so far, and having a PhD in mathematical geophysics (and I even was forced to take a little geology along the way...ugh), I believe that the website I lifted from one of the previous contributors gives the best explanation. . . No one completely knows the contribution of each of these potential sources of the core's heat. One of the biggest mysteries is how much heat is produced by radioactive decay. Presumably any radioactive materials would have sunk to the core because they are denser than most other materials, but the actual quantity of radioactive elements in the core is unknown."
3555750,Q0,3555750_2,0.3333333333333333,2,Why is the earth's core hot?,I dont know but i believe the bible says that hell is in the earth's core.

3555750,Q0,3555750_1,1.0,1,Why is the earth's core hot?,"Heat in the core of planets cannot be entirely due to nuclear reactions, because that source would require a gradual build-up rather than a gradual loss of heat. However, nuclear reactions could be occurring in the core, because heat and pressure should promote them. But then they must be producing heat at a lower rate than it is being lost through radiation into space. Otherwise, there would not be the observed cool-down."

Also, I am not sure whether this question is about a small claim court or not, but there are a lot to say.  If this is a small claim court matter, go ahead of represent your corporation because an attorney cannot represent the corporation in a small claim court proceeding.

She took a chance when she tried heroin.  Think about whether or not she knew that herion was a serious drug to take.  Many people die a year of heroin on their first time use.

Just take what you know of the Bible.  Does it ever say that God will ""take"" someone to teach others a lesson.. . Blaming God for your friend using heroin.

My dad had a heart attack because he did not take care of himself.  He was actually young.   . Your friend died because she took a chance on heroin.   . Be angry at God if you need to be.

I wont go on, cause what i have to say next, from own experience, its too controversial, but that is an explanation right there... just be aware, that there are some others that have it easier *not the richest, dont be so materialistic, that the richest are mostly the poorest in spirit, but not all, but most...*. .

I am not an overly religious person, but I have had instances in my life that makes me believe in angels, or spiritual guides, whatever you want to call them....it just seems to make sense to me.

It is a part of the grieving process to run the gamit of emotions, denial, hurt, sadness, anger and you just have to let yourself feel the feelings but know that it is no shame to seek help from this and if you do feel this anger towards God, there is lots of help available from professional grief counsellors available out there to help you work through all your anger, fears, etc.  I wish you the best in your journey and hope you make it to the other side where the joy and gratitude can fill your heart.  I mean joy from having this special person in your life and gratitude for the many things good that this person brought into your life even in her very short time.  It is perfectly okay to be mad at God and to question God so don't take on any guilt if you are, regardless of what others say.  I know this sounds very contrite under the circumstances, but I really believe if God leads you to it...He will lead you through it!"
1474989,Q0,1474989_36,1.0,36,why does God take the young?,"I originally wrote this to answer someone else's question, but it fits so well here I have added some and put it here for you to read. Please check out the web sites.. ---. It seems unfair, doesn't it? David and Job both had the same question. The answer is found in looking at God's original plan for our world. He created a perfect world, and had no intention of us experiencing sin. However, God is love, and love by definition gives a choice. Satan chose against God, and convinced Adam and Eve to do the same. Could God have prevented this choice? Well, yes, but then would it have been a choice? No, it would have automatically turned us into robots who serve God because there's no choice. God wants our love because we want to give it.. . Could God have destroyed Satan in the very beginning and avoided all this? Yes, but then the universe for the rest of eternity would have served Him out of fear, wondering if they would be the next ones to be wiped out. No, God chose to let sin work its course so that the entire universe could see that He is LOVE and gives choice. Believe me, when he comes soon and destroys Satan, none of us will EVER want to choose sin again. The universe will be entirely safe for eternity.. . And, does all this sin hurt God? Yes!!! It hurt Him so much that He gave His Son to come and live here and be killed by us so that we could live forever. What amazing love! He is hurt terribly every time ANYTHING bad happens. The Bible even says that he sees a sparrow fall - he cares more than we can understand. But, were He to always keep bad things from happening, He would be taking away someone's free choice.. . The question is, will you seek to understand God more because of what happened? It seems that you are. God didn't kill your friend, He simply allowed sin to take its course. What He wants more than anything is for a personal relationship with each person on this earth. Death in this life isn't the end - there is eternity, and if you choose Him you can spend it with Him."
1474989,Q0,1474989_37,1.0,37,why does God take the young?,"God puts every one of us on this earth for a reason. Only God knows that reason. When we have done our earthly duty, He will take us back to be with Him. In the case of your dear friend, maybe she was here to teach that very lesson to someone. That ""someone"" could very well have been you, but it could just as easily have been the jackass who gave it to her. Maybe God was trying to ""save"" him. Only God knows that. Whatever you do, don't let her death be in vain. Take up the cause and warn people NOT to start. As long as you believe, you WILL see your friend again! In the meantime, she is probably your guardian angel, so keep thinking about her, talking to her, and loving her."

Street drugs are not safe for many reasons, ie. dosages aren't accurate and you can't be sure what's in there. I don't think God took her as an example. I think that guy killed her, but ultimately it was her choice."
1474989,Q0,1474989_35,0.6666666666666666,35,why does God take the young?,"I think you're asking the wrong question.  I believe in God, a greater power.  I don't believe in Satan, despite the many people who've answered you that seem to.  People don't like to take responsibility for the bad things in the world or the choices they make.  I do believe that we all have lessons to learn in this life and without getting into too much detail on my beliefs, it was her time to go.  I know that isn't going to make you feel any better but if you truly believe that we all have a soul/spirit, this spirit knows far more than our conscious mind does.  You see this as a great injustice because you don't understand it and you're the one left behind.  If you believe in God, you must also believe that there is more after death.  She's in a better place.  If you believe in many lives, you will meet her again at some point.  . . Whatever you believe, I hope you find your way through this.  If we understood God, we wouldn't need to be placed on this earth.  Close your eyes and picture a happy memory of your friend and keep that with you.  I'm sure she's wishing you peace."

Why would an almighty being control every single life and death of comparatively insignificant creatures? More accurately, most die without any intervention; if God truly has an effect on one's end at this point, it's to perhaps prevent it, which doesn't happen as often as you would think a just God would allow. But other than that, I guess people just die. How can people still try to reason suicide bombers and stillborn infants and mass murderers as ""part of His divine plan""? At this point, I don't think ANYTHING happens for a reason..."

It turns out however, that your friend did something really stupid and her death was a consequence of her action.. . Sin has negative consequences (even though it is unfashionable in our world to speak of sin and of consequences).... . The people responsible for your friend's death are (a) herself, (b) the drug pusher, (c) the guy who injected her, and (d) her friends who did nothing to stop her from doing heroin.. . It is not necessary for us to think that God killed her (as an example to us or for any other reason).. . God gave her the power to keep her life or throw it away. She chose to throw it away.. . We can choose to use her death as an example to us (or we can choose to not learn anything from this event).. . I know that what I am saying can sound harsh. But there is love behind these words. If the example of your friend's death keeps you from doing drugs, then her death was not in vain.. . Cordially,. John. http://www.GodSci.org"

But I want you to know this - God didn't take your friend.  It was not His will that your friend should die like that - believe me, He loves your friend and is weeping with you.  The fact that such a tragedy happened doesn't mean He is powerless or cruel, it simply means that sin has consequences.  I know that I have felt the consequence of my own sin, we all have; sometimes it is tragic, like your friend's death.. . Your friend was living from her own brokenness, she was trying to fill the void in her heart - just like I do, just like you do.  God's desire is that we be reconciled to Him through His Son Jesus Christ, and live according to His will.  It is totally natural for you to have doubts during such a hard time.  But God will not allow your tears to be wasted.  Just as he weeps over the loss of your friend, he weeps with you and stands ready to comfort you when you are ready to return to Him.

It is a horrible thing that happened to you friend. I could not have wished that on anyone.. I don't know that God is teaching others a lesson by taking her life. God does allow these things to happen, though. It doesn't seem fair sometimes. This world is full of hate and despair and so many of us fall victim to it's deceitfulness everyday.. There is no good answer as to why it had to be your friend. None of us are immune from the choices we make. We take a risk just by walking down the street. . .

Since you asked, God did not force your friend to shoot up on heroin.  When you do this whether it is the first time or the 59th time only two things can happen and both of them are bad.  First you can get hooked and second you can die.  There is no good except for a temporary feeling you may achieve.  It is stupid.  . . I am sorry about your friend.  But just know that God did not do this to make an example of her.  Satan is the one who tempted your friend.  God does not tempt anyone.  Some time He will test us but He never puts more on us than we can handle.  Your friend made a choice to try heroin and the outcome was bad for her, her family, and all of her friends.  God bless you and I hope you learn to overcome the hurt and the loss.  I believe from your question that your friend was probably a Christian and if that is true she is with Jesus now and the two of you will have a wonderful reunion one day.  She will be waiting on you."

Fourth, it is each person's FREE WILL to decide WHY anything happens and WHO are you in relation to it?. . Fifth, TIME is an illusion of this tangible reality...  nothing happens on accident because there isn't anything God doesn't know about before it happens.  . . Your friend made a decision of FREE WILL..... and now she understands exactly what the risk really was.  But God loves her as much now and ever, because God IS love and God is all ways God.. . When it is your ""time"" to go home, God will show you the way...... and everything will make sense to you then.. . You are not required to understand everything.... that is why FAITH is important.  . . If God intends for you to KNOW, you will know.  If not, then have faith that God is showing you all you need for now.. . You are going to be okay.... God will not give you more than you can handle.  . . God didn't TAKE your friend to ""hurt"" you... Your friend made a choice and choices effect all of us.  You are closer to her than me, so you feel it more.. . Feelings are HUMAN/Conditional.... enjoy your tears for now.. . Sad is HOW you are able to recognize HAPPY.. . Blessings to you."

1474989,Q0,1474989_1,1.0,1,why does God take the young?,"I've heard from many who believe in god that the god of Christian understanding is a god who allows choice.  This includes the choice to believe in him or not, and the choice to shoot up heroin or not.  If god were to interviene, he would not be allowing choice.  Or, more precisely, he would not be allowing humans to be responsible for the actions that they take."
1474989,Q0,1474989_69,0.6666666666666666,69,why does God take the young?,"God does not ""take"" anyone in death. death is of the devil, not God."
1474989,Q0,1474989_49,1.0,49,why does God take the young?,"The reason we die is simple, it's heredity Romans 5:12.  The way people die are varied.  In the case of your friend, she made a bad decision and lost her life.  Ezekiel 18:32 shows us God's view of death. “‘For I do not take any delight in the death of someone dying,"" Ez 33:11 also, ""“I take delight, not in the death of the wicked one, but in that someone wicked turns back from his way and actually keeps living.(if he got another angel, why would he not delight in death?)  1 Corinthians 15:26 death is called our enemy.  Psalm 73 is very helpful because a faithful person almost gave up because the good people seemed to suffer more.  I will say there is nothing in the bible to prove the idea of God taking people because he needs another angel, that's something he never said.  John 5:28,29 and Rom  5:21 remind us of the hope we can have.  Ecclesiastes 9:11 also helps us see why bad thing happen to good people.  You can also look at the account of Job, who caused all those bad thing in his life?  Hope some of this helps."
1474989,Q0,1474989_24,1.0,24,why does God take the young?,"It's hard when God does not meet our expectations by intervening when we make stupid choices.  Your anger, sadness, and hurt are normal.  But whoever told you that God kills people as examples was not paying attention to the love of God or the questions your heart is asking.  That person probably thought they were helping by making something up, but no one fully understands death except the one who conquered it.. . Your friend did not die because God issued a command from heaven. She died doing illicit hard drugs.  You are probably mad at her for being so stupid since you love her so much.  It's hard to be angry with our dead loved ones because we don't want to betray their memory.  But your friend would understand that you are mad because you love her and wanted her to stay with you, so you could live your lives in one another's company. . . We all die at some time or another.  Some of those deaths occur to newborn babies, some to ripe old people.  God does not prevent deaths because God's love can work even through and beyond death.   I could say more on this subject, but I think it's probably more important right now that you focus on the love you still have for your friend.  God shares that love for her.  Her death was not for a cruel lesson, nor was it a demonstration that God no longer loves her.  God still loves your friend more than you can ever know.  Love for your friend is something you and God have in common.  Maybe God can help you learn to keep loving her even though she's gone?  It's okay to be openly pissed off at God, too.  If anyone can take it, God can.  But don't block out your greatest ally in love just because things turned out differently than you expected."

You lost someone you love, I lost my best friend in a school riot in 72, my faith was hit hard too.  I prayed all night please lord don't take him.  But he did.  It took me years to realize that it was his time.  I believe to this day my friend is with the lord and I will never doubt it.

1474989,Q0,1474989_26,1.0,26,why does God take the young?,"My dad was killed in a head-on collision when he was 70.  It was horribly sudden and unfair, but he was a good man and we loved him very much.  I immediately knew he didn't feel the crash, and that he probably didn't have time to react.  It was, IMHO, God's way of telling us he'd lived enough, and it was time for him to go home.. . I don't like the idea of using other people's deaths as an example of what not to do.  What then do we make of children murdered at the hands of their parents?  Did the parents make appropriate ""examples"" of these victims?  What kind of ""example"" should we make out of me losing my dad?. . Your friend had a very serious problem, and one that is difficult to overcome.  I'm sorry for your loss.  I hope the guy who administered the shot now needs to answer for what evil he did.  God didn't kill her, though.  He gives us free will, even when this is difficult for him to do, and knowing that we still make mistakes.  . . When you're a parent, you'll understand this.  When you let your kids go out into the world, you have no idea what kind of trouble they can get into when you're not looking.  You hope your kids will make the right decisions, but you understand that eventually these decisions are not yours to make.  God is like that.  He is our father and watches over us and tries to protect us, but He will never control the decisions we make."

Your friend was not an example - she was a child of God, and believe me, he loves her.  You are left here on this earth, but she is in a better place now.  Try to take it a day at a time.  As you grow older and experience life's joys and trials, the hole in your heart will heal.  Live a good life, remember your friend, and cherish her memory.  You will see her again, I promise."

She used her free will to take the drug that killed her. If you want someone to blame, blame Lucifer (devil,satan,evil,ect.) for putting the temptation in front of her. And if you were strong in your faith you would know that she is in a much better place than here with us."
1474989,Q0,1474989_46,0.6666666666666666,46,why does God take the young?,"First of all I am sorry for your loss. Secondly part of you question indicated ""he kills people as examples"" part of your answer is that God does not kill people.Heroin killed her not God, and yes as unfair as it may be, she made that choice not God, and the fact she died when others can do heroin for years is not a provision from God, he does not say this one can be an addict forever, and this on dies on their first attempt,addicts hurt God as well I am sure,God is love and anyone loving a person would not want to see them suffer addiction.If you must blame God for her choices,then perhaps you could just presume God wanted to spare her and the others in her life her impending addiction,maybe she would not have stopped at the first time trial,is as far as saying God killed her for trying heroin, because he did not.Whenever I am faced with situations where I want to blame God and in my limited understanding cannot fathom how he could let something happen that is so painful to me, I am reminded of a scripture that helps me and hopefully will help you ""Trust in the lord with all your heart,lean not on your own understanding, but acknowledge him in all ways,and he will make your path straight."" This reminds me that because something occurs that seems so unfair or beyond my understanding ,and I may want to blame God, to instead rely on his understanding of the situation,and trust him to help me recover and be a better envoy for him and a better person for me.some things aren't fair but God does not choose what is fair and does not interfere with our choices,he will not alter our choice or consequence, but he will help me through, and he will help me to make better choices,Don't blame God for her demise,blame the person that gave her the dope or helped her get it and blame the people that left her thinking it was something should she give a try, they killed her not God."

Isaiah 57:1 got me through the terrible grief I had to suffer:  ""The righteous pass away;the godly often die before their time.  And no one seems to care or wonder why. No one seems to understand that God is protecting them from the evil to come. For the godly who die will rest in peace.. . I was comforted by this scripture and it helped me to realize that even though we don't know ""why"" young people die, there is hope that someone much more Powerful and All-knowing has it in His plan.  For me, it changed my whole perspective on what was important in life.  God does not allow death to teach a lesson, I do not believe this is how God is, BUT...I do believe He allows such tragedies to bring us closer to Him if that is what we choose to do.

1474989,Q0,1474989_45,1.0,45,why does God take the young?,The best answer I have is that perhaps God needed your friend in heaven more than he felt your friend needed to stay here on earth...the best part is that one day in the future you will see your friend again...walking streets of gold and singing with the angels!  God does not kill...no one really knows why he allows death other than it is the result of sin and evil coming into the world... I highly suggest that you take the time to talk with either your pastor or school counselor or another friend as you try to deal with the death of you best friend... do not try to do it alone or it will eat you up inside!  You were in her life for a reason and most likely having known her will help you in ways you cannot begin to imagine right now...

The Hubble telescope has a resolution of 0.1 arc-second.  At the range to the moon (roughly a quarter million miles), one arc second is a spot with a diameter of about 15 meters (~50 feet).. . The largest piece of equipment we left behind on the moon was the bottom portion of the LEM, which was about 4 meters across.. . So even with the Hubble, the best telescope running, the LEM would cover an area less than one pixel on the CCD cameras used to record the picture.. .

The problems of using earth bound telescopes, is our own atmosphere which causes distortion, thereby decreasing the telescopes resolving power.. .

Even telescopes with a resolution comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope can only resolve details about 100 meters across (the size of a football or soccer field). Lasers fired from Earth are bounced off special retro-reflectors left at these sites by the astronauts, and the faint return pulse is then detected by Earth-based telescopes equipped with special instruments to measure the Earth-moon distance, but otherwise, we can't see any man-made equipment left at the landing sites.

Personally feel the prophet Mohammed peace and blessings of God be upon him would have been disgusted!  I think a peace full protest would have been good because the cartoons were very offensive.. . With regards to the Terrorists a lot of prominent Muslim figures have denounced the terrorism publicly.  But all real practicing Muslims are against these terrorists, but there not goin onto the streets. . . The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said about not being anxious to engage in the battlefield and to pray for peace and security instead.  . . If we studied honestly and objectively the life of the Prophet from authentic and unbiased sources we will find that he never engaged in the battlefield nor did he approve of battles other than to repel aggression, including legitimate pre-emptive strike against pending attack, or to stop aggression or persecution.  . . It is known that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) lived in a very simple and self-imposed simplicity like any poor person lived. When he died he owned virtuously nothing.

3752394,Q0,3752394_5,1.0,5,Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?,"Good point u came too, . Why? , . i think because for The prophet cartoons, these cartoons were a direct insult for most precious person for any muslim in the world,so how ever how the person is educated he&#92;she will understand the insult and will protest against it. . . then why this doesnt' happen for terrorism?... i think this have many reasons,. 1. the most remarakable terrorism action is 9/11 and it was against americans, and many muslims dont like americans, so they didnt care that 2000 americans were dead, then the question why they dont like americans? for this answer check this : http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Ah3tUGeQCVPkY2mLcZSIecjsy6IX?qid=1006041322001. . 2.Many islamic leaders already objected on the terrorism actions and trying there best to stop it. . . 3.For the muslim youth (at least as i see them in my country), why protesting against terrorism which kills americans and israelians, in the time those americans and israeilans are killing muslims in afganistan, Iraq and were killing then since 50 years in palastine and STILL killing them there till now, so we do they protest ?, by their way of thinking, it's just justice! . . That doesn't mean that terrorism is accepted at all, just when u r attacked and killed and your land is taken and occupied dont expect that those occuped people will go and protest for the occuper rights ? that doesn't make sence right ? . . 4. For me ( I am a muslim girl) i would like very much to go and protest against terrorism , but you dont undestand that protesting and making demonestration is something very hard in here, and would lead to many bad results, it's not easy at all to go and say ""No for terrorism"" the way the police and government deals with demonestrations in here still needs great developing to be really modern.. .  I hope you got the others point of view about the whole matter."
3752394,Q0,3752394_4,1.0,4,Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?,a good question!!. well Islam is not the religion of terrorism and i must admit that Muslims did a very bad thing by protesting against i don't say protest is bad but protest in a way that there mustn't be any death or any causalities around protesting against Denmark didn't effect the Denmark as it affects the Muslims countries where the protests held..they(Muslims) encountered a lot of death causalities by the protesting its only the Imams who protest these things and give a wrong view to the innocent Muslims that if u don't protest u r a non-Muslim i wanna ask Muslims they are always doing bad deeds against Islam but wen it comes to some thing like cartoons or what so ever they protest in a such a ruide way that a lot of causalities occur. i wanna say in the last there a lot of facts about Muhammad)PB UH) are there explained in the Holy Quran that He suffered a lot form non-muslims of that ERA but He didnt wish for any death causilites from them infact God(Allah) ask Him much to wish for any casulities but He refused.. The only thing is that muslims are not following their religion completly they only follow the Islamic points which are an easy task for them.

Her mate was so distraught that I replaced the bird within a few days for his sake.  Otherwise, I would probably have lost him too.     I felt I had no choice in the matter.   However, for a few months, I resented the new bird.   Every time I looked at her in the other bird's aviary, eating her food, playing with her toys I hated her.    I have this bird 3 years now and she is the most adorable bird I could have.    I felt so guilty for my feelings after wards.   At the time I wasn't ready for her.   I think you need to give yourself time for your grief.   Then, when you are ready to love another bird, get one.

2343388,Q0,2343388_2,1.0,2,what actions i should start to take and what not to take in the case of electrocution?,"It will partly depend on the severity of the electrocution.. . However the first thing to do in any electrocution (indeed any situation you come across) is to check for danger - you're not going to be any help if you get hurt too! Isolate any electricity supplies at the mains, or even better, at the fuse board BEFORE touching the casualty or going anywhere near them. . . The casualty may be conscious or unconsious. If they're conscious, just call an ambulance and while waiting for them, see if you can find where the entry and exit marks are - the electricity will have either passed over the surface of the body, causing burns (treat with cold running water for 10 mins or a cold compress if you can not get the affected part to running water), otherwise the electricity will have gone through the body and have caused an internal burn.. . If the casualty is unconscious, check their airway and see if you can check for breathing, call an ambulance, and they will instruct you to do CPR if necessary. Continue until the ambulance people take over (don't just stop because they have arrived). If they are not breathing, it is likely their heart has stopped too, so if you're in a place that has a defibrillator available - get someone to bring it to you, it will give them the best chance of survival and they're really easy to use."

The wall trick kinda works but if you wait that long your spaghetti will be over cooked. You need to take it out of the water before it's looks done. The noodles will continue to cook themselves for about five minutes after they're taken out of the water. The rule is 6 minutes of cooking per serving. And remember to add salt and oil to the water before you heat it. The salt allows the water to boil at a higher temperature making for faster cooking, and the oil keeps the noodles from sticking together. Good luck."

First, take a spaghetto and chew on it. If there is a hard center and a soft outside it is done if you are cooking it Al Dante. If you want it cooked thoroughly, boil it until it is soft all of the way through. You can also throw a Spaghetto at any vertical surface. If it sticks, it is done. If it rolls, it is not done. This is not a very good technique because even if the noodle is overedone, it will stick.. . Hope that helps."

1458676,U0,1458676_12,1.0,12,why do criminals go back to the scene of the crime?,Because they want to see what is going on and if it has been discovered and if it is being investigated.

4317709,Q0,4317709_3,1.0,3,How and what can I do to make my girl climax?,I asked a question like this about a week ago. I was worried that something was wrong with me because I couldnt have a vaginal orgasm only from clitoral stimulation. My question eventually got deleted but before it did I had learned from several woman and a website that most woman dont experience vaginal orgasms. There arnt very many nerves inside a woman's vagina. The main sexual organ is the clitoris. Usually woman fake it because they dont want the man to feel bad. If you want her to have an orgasm you need to constantly stimulate the clitoris during vaginal sex. Try having sex ''spooning'' she can bring her leg back exposing her clitoris and you can stimulate it with your fingers. You can also have her be on top and place a figure under her clitoris and while she is ''riding'' you she can stimulate her clitoris. I tried these things and it works! I hope I could help!

2982426,Q0,2982426_8,1.0,8,What is it that causes you to sneeze?,"A sneeze is a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the nose and mouth. An unimpeded sneeze sends two to five thousand bacteria-filled droplets into the air. The medical name for sneezing is sternutation.. . Sneezing is generally caused by irritation in the passages of the nose. Pollens, house dust, and other particles are usually harmless, but when they irritate the nose the body responds by expelling them from the nasal passages. The nose mistakes strong odors, sudden chills, bright lights (see photic sneeze reflex), and even orgasms in some people for nasal irritants, and it tries to defend itself with a sneeze.. . It is almost impossible for one to keep one's eyelids open during a sneeze, although some rare individuals report having little if any trouble doing so. The reflex of shutting the eyes serves no obvious purpose: the nerves serving the eyes and the nose are closely related, and stimuli to the one often trigger some response in the other."

2573745,Q0,2573745_0,1.0,0,How did African American women get the right to Vote?,"Amendment XV (the Fifteenth Amendment) of the United States Constitution grants voting rights regardless of race.. . The amendment is one of the post-Civil War, Reconstruction amendments. It was ratified on February 3, 1870.. . This amendment prohibits the states or the federal government from using a citizen's race, color, or previous status as a slave as a voting qualification. Its basic purpose was to enfranchise former slaves. But it was not really until the Voting Rights Act in 1965, almost a century later, that this purpose was actually achieved in all states.. . The first person to vote under the provisions of the amendment was Thomas Mundy Peterson.. . After the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which barred slavery, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed former slaves citizenship, there were still fears by the Radical Republicans that sympathizers to the Confederate cause would attempt to achieve through suppression of the black vote what they could not obtain by war. No southern state had ever had a black elected official, and most southern states even prohibited the vote to freed slaves and free-born blacks. Blacks were known to be sympathetic to the Republicans thanks to their clear anti-slavery policies, and the efforts of the Republicans with Reconstruction after the American Civil War. As to the fear that southern legislatures would restrict the vote to whites as they did before the Civil War, the amendment was clearly justified and, in retrospect, the fears of the Radicals were well founded. They also saw a political opportunity to break the hold of the Democratic Party over the deep south.. . After the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, southern blacks voted in numbers that on a per capita basis would probably exceed black political participation today. On both a per capita and absolute basis, more blacks were elected to political office during the period from 1865 to 1880 than at any other time in American history. Although no state elected a black governor during Reconstruction, a number of state legislatures were effectively under the control of a substantial African American caucus. These legislatures brought in programs that are considered part of government's duty now, but at the time were radical, such as universal public education. They also set aside all racially biased laws, even those prohibiting interracial marriage.. . Despite the efforts of groups like the Ku Klux Klan to intimidate black voters and white Republicans, assurance of federal support for democratically elected southern governments meant that most Republican voters could both vote and rule in confidence. For example, when an all-white mob attempted to take over the interracial government of New Orleans, President Ulysses S. Grant sent in federal troops to restore the elected mayor.. . However, after the close election of Rutherford B. Hayes, Hayes, in order to mollify the South, agreed to withdraw federal troops. He also overlooked poll violence in the deep south, despite several attempts by the Republicans to pass laws assuring the rights of black voters and to punish intimidation. To show the unwillingness of Congress to take any action at this time, even a bill that would have required incidents of violence only at polling places to be publicized failed to be passed. Without the restrictions, voting place violence against blacks and Republicans increased, including instances of murder. Most of this was done without any interference by law enforcement, and often even with their co-operation.. . By the 1890s, many southern states had rigorous voter qualification laws, including literacy tests and poll taxes. Some states even made it difficult to find a place to register to vote. Most of these laws were race neutral, but clearly discriminated against black voters, either through their construction or their administration. For example, most states required literacy tests, but voters were exempt if they could prove t"

The origins and apparent extinction of certain species of locust—some of which reach 6 inches (15 cm) in length—are unclear.. .

2736707,Q0,2736707_3,1.0,3,what is locust?,"A locust is a large GRASSHOPPER showing pronounced, density-dependent polymorphism, that is, the development of different types of individuals brought about by changes in the size, or numbers, of their population. About a dozen species in the short-horned grasshopper family, Acrididae, have evolved this capacity to change their habits and appearance according to their population density. When populations are sparse, the individuals live separate lives and migrate singly at night, like other grasshoppers. As their numbers increase, however, they respond to more frequent encounters with one another by becoming more and more gregarious, active, and conspicuous. They form mobs of ""hoppers"" (nymphs) and adults, which migrate by day in a uniquely itinerant mode of life, mating and reproducing as they travel. The swarming and nonswarming forms are known, respectively, as the gregarious and solitarious phases. Phase transformation occurs in stages. The solitarious phase is always present, whereas the gregarious phase appears only sporadically and only in areas where food supplies and other factors vary markedly. Under sufficiently crowded conditions, a solitarious hopper will mature into a gregarious adult, with longer wings, shorter legs, and other identifiable characteristics. As more and more of the gregarious types appear, characterized by their restless movement, migratory swarms build up. Once started, a locust plague may last for several years while generations of the swarms overrun regions in which the solitarious phase cannot maintain itself. The swarms eventually die out and scatter, leaving only the solitarious phase.. . Because of their mobility and devastating effects on crops, swarming locusts are greatly feared and difficult to control. The most famous species--the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, which roams over central and north Africa, the Middle East, and India--was mentioned in the Old Testament and even earlier.. . The periodical cicadas, family Cicadidae, whose life cycles are 13 or 17 years long, are locally known as 13-year or 17-year locusts. They are not true locusts, however, and are related to the aphids and treehoppers, order Homoptera."

877139,U0,877139_0,1.0,0,What's the difference between a paradox and a contradiction?,a contradiction is two or more opposing statements on the same subject.  A paradox is a situation where the existence of one preclude the possiblity of the others.
877139,Q0,877139_2,1.0,2,What's the difference between a paradox and a contradiction?,"The most commonly discussed form is a contradiction arising in the logic of sets or classes. Some classes (or sets) seem to be members of themselves, while some do not. The class of all classes is itself a class, and so it seems to be in itself. The null or empty class, however, must not be a member of itself. However, suppose that we can form a class of all classes (or sets) that, like the null class, are not included in themselves. The paradox arises from asking the question of whether this class is in itself. It is if and only if it is not. The other form is a contradiction involving properties. Some properties seem to apply to themselves, while others do not. The property of being a property is itself a property, while the propery of being a cat is not itself a cat. Consider the property that something has just in case it is a property (like that of being a cat) that does not apply to itself. Does this property apply to itself? Once again, from either assumption, the opposite follows. The paradox was named after Bertrand Russell, who discovered it in 1901."

877139,Q0,877139_7,0.6666666666666666,7,What's the difference between a paradox and a contradiction?,"Yes, yes, you could, or course, go by the dictionary definitions, and let letters and words make the answer. Still, since we are talking about philosophy, it might be necessary to go deeper into the topic. As far as I comprehend it, a paradox is something that neither science nor philosophy has managed to sufficiently explain. The answer may lie in religion and belief, but many think such resources are not trustworthy. A contradiction, on the other hand, is a simple disagreement. We might have theories about the topic from sources that tell us this and that, and since  the correct answer in science is not always determined by a vote of majority, we have before us a number of (or just two) different theories or ideologies. Then it is a biased decision when we are asked the question.... I hope you can comprehend... have a nice day."

877139,Q0,877139_5,1.0,5,What's the difference between a paradox and a contradiction?,"A paradox is a construction that we believe has false premises, logic or both. ""Walking is less tiring than standing"" seems paradoxical because there is an underlying premise that walking uses more muscles and therefore should be more tiring. In fact, the muscles used are different and the minor muscles used in maintaining an immobile erect posture fatigue more easily. So, it turns out that 'tiring' isn't what we thought it was going in.. . There are paradoxes that aren't yet resolved. But the belief is that that is a failure of understanding and not a statement about how the world actually is."

It's not really that they are bad, they are just lost."

If you are not opposed to the technique a good thump on the nose or a light flick of the ear may also be a deterent but the cat also may percieve this as playing.  Understand the cat is not being mean.  It is an animal and thinks its actions are either playing or defending what it thinks belongs to it.  You just have to modify this behaviour so it suits you."

Additionally if you support a literal translation of the bible, then evolution and an old earth is in opposition to creationism.  If the bible is wrong here, where else is it wrong?  How is it inspired by God?  If you don't think it is all literal, then there is no problem.. .

2867851,Q0,2867851_5,1.0,5,How does evolution disprove god?,"Evolution doesn't disprove God. How can evolution disprove God when evolution hasn't been and will never be proven?  Evolution isn't mathematically possible. The complexity of life points to Intelligent Design as revealed by such complex structures as:. . Cells and DNA. . In Darwin's time, scientists thought cells were just blobs of protoplasm. Since that time the advance of science has uncovered ever more powerful evidence that what Christians believe is true on all levels, including the natural world. And that is becoming even clearer today as scientists learn more about what is inside the cell-and especially the structure of DNA.. . According to cell biologist Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences, ""The entire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines."". . Even the simplest cells are bristling with high-tech machinery. On the outside, their surfaces are studded with sensors, gates, pumps and identification markers.. . Inside, cells are jam-packed with power plants, automated workshops and recycling units. Miniature monorails whisk materials from one location to another. No such system could arise in a blind, step-by-step Darwinian process.. . The most advanced, automated modern factory, with its computers and robots all coordinated on a precisely timed schedule, is less complex than the inner workings of a single cell.. . ""A bacterium is far more complex than any inanimate system known to man. There is not a laboratory in the world which can compete with the biochemical activity of the smallest living organism. One cell is more complicated than the largest computer that man has ever made."" - Sir James Gray, from Cambridge University. . DNA is like a language in the heart of the cell, a molecular message, a set of instructions telling the cell how to construct proteins-much like the software needed to run a computer. Moreover, the amount of information DNA includes is staggering: A single cell of the human body contains three or four times more information as all 30 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica. As a result, the question of the origin of life must now be redefined as the question of the origin of biological information. Can information arise by natural forces alone? Or does it require an intelligent agent?. . DNA is composed of ordinary chemicals (bases, sugars, phosphates that react according to ordinary laws. What makes DNA function as a message is not the chemicals themselves but rather their sequence, their pattern. The chemicals in DNA are grouped into molecules (called nucleotides) that act like letters in a message, and they must be in a particular order if the message is going to be intelligible. If the letters are scrambled, the result is nonsense. So the crucial question is whether the sequence of chemical ""letters"" arose by natural causes or whether it required an intelligent source. Is it the product of law or design?. . Since DNA contains information, the case can be stated even more strongly in terms of information theory, a field of research that investigates the ways information is transmitted. The naturalistic scientist has only two possible ways to explain the origin of life-either chance or natural law. But information theory provides a powerful tool for discounting both of these explanations. Both chance and law lead to structures with low information content, whereas DNA has a very high information content."". . The sequence of basis in DNA can not be explained by natural law because there are no chemical laws that make any sequence more likely than another. At the same time these sequences are so complicated that they can not be explained by chance.. . ""Based on probability factors any viable DNA strand having over 84 nucleotides cannot be the result of haphazard mutations. At that stage, the probabil"
2867851,Q0,2867851_4,1.0,4,How does evolution disprove god?,"I don't see evolution (with all the connotations the Christian church has given it) as disproving God because both the Biblical account and Darwin and Wallace's statements on natural selection -- the technical term for evolution -- contain a process.  Between you and me, it's easier to have faith in God creating Adam and Eve out of dust than it is to believe that their descendants developed over miollions of years from a ""lower"" form.  . . It seems many people get confused by viewing evolution as a theory of creation rather than development.  That's often the perspective of people who say ""evolution proves God"".  By providing a studiable (is that a word?) and testable process of life's development and not its creation, God should appreciate the proof of His handiwork that some people choose to be blind to see."

This theory, which claims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was invalidated by the scientific evidence of clear ""design"" in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.. Yet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This . ""intelligent design"" is a scientific expression of the fact that God created all living things.. We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of creation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and are still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here.. . . (THE SCIENTIFIC COLLAPSE OF DARWINISM). . Although this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, published in 1859. In this book, he denied that God created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an ""assumption."" Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled ""Difficulties of the Theory,"" the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. . Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:. 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. . 2) No scientific finding shows that the ""evolutionary mechanisms"" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all. . 3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests.. . The power evolutionists impute to the three force they believe to have produced life—time, mud, and chance—is actually enough to elevate them into a trinity. They believe that the combination of these random forces gave shape to the human brain, intelligence, cognitive ability, judgment and memory.. In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines:. . . The First Insurmountable Step: . (The Origin of Life). . The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this ""first cell"" or"

2867851,Q0,2867851_18,0.3333333333333333,18,How does evolution disprove god?,"10 dangers of theistic evolution. by Werner Gitt. . The atheistic formula for evolution is:. . Evolution = matter + evolutionary factors (chance and necessity + mutation + selection + isolation + death) + very long time periods.. . In the theistic evolutionary view, God is added:. . Theistic evolution = matter + evolutionary factors (chance and necessity + mutation + selection + isolation + death) + very long time periods + God.. . In this system God is not the omnipotent Lord of all things, whose Word has to be taken seriously by all men, but He is integrated into the evolutionary philosophy. This leads to 10 dangers for Christians.1. . Danger no. 1: Misrepresentation of the Nature of God. The Bible reveals God to us as our Father in Heaven, who is absolutely perfect (Matthew 5:48), holy (Isaiah 6:3), and omnipotent (Jeremiah 32:17). The Apostle John tells us that ‘God is love’, ‘light’, and ‘life’ (1 John 4:16; 1:5; 1:1-2). When this God creates something, His work is described as ‘very good’ (Genesis 1:31) and ‘perfect’ (Deuteronomy 32:4).. . Theistic evolution gives a false representation of the nature of God because death and ghastliness are ascribed to the Creator as principles of creation. (Progressive creationism, likewise, allows for millions of years of death and horror before sin.). . Danger no. 2: God becomes a God of the Gaps. The Bible states that God is the Prime Cause of all things. ‘But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things … and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him’ (1 Corinthians 8:6).. . However, in theistic evolution the only workspace allotted to God is that part of nature which evolution cannot ‘explain’ with the means presently at its disposal. In this way He is reduced to being a ‘god of the gaps’ for those phenomena about which there are doubts. This leads to the view that ‘God is therefore not absolute, but He Himself has evolved—He is evolution’.2. . Danger no. 3: Denial of Central Biblical Teachings . The entire Bible bears witness that we are dealing with a source of truth authored by God (2 Timothy 3:16), with the Old Testament as the indispensable ‘ramp’ leading to the New Testament, like an access road leads to a motor freeway (John 5:39). The biblical creation account should not be regarded as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, but as a historical report, because:. . Biological, astronomical and anthropological facts are given in didactic [teaching] form. . In the Ten Commandments God bases the six working days and one day of rest on the same time-span as that described in the creation account (Exodus 20:8-11). . In the New Testament Jesus referred to facts of the creation (e.g. Matthew 19:4-5). . Nowhere in the Bible are there any indications that the creation account should be understood in any other way than as a factual report. . The doctrine of theistic evolution undermines this basic way of reading the Bible, as vouched for by Jesus, the prophets and the Apostles. Events reported in the Bible are reduced to mythical imagery, and an understanding of the message of the Bible as being true in word and meaning is lost.. . Danger no. 4: Loss of the Way for Finding God . The Bible describes man as being completely ensnared by sin after Adam’s fall (Romans 7:18-19). Only those persons who realize that they are sinful and lost will seek the Saviour who ‘came to save that which was lost’ (Luke 19:10).. . However, evolution knows no sin in the biblical sense of missing one’s purpose (in relation to God). Sin is made meaningless, and that is exactly the opposite of what the Holy Spirit does—He declares sin to be sinful. If sin is seen as a harmless evolutionary factor, then one has lost the key for finding God, which is not resolved by adding ‘God’ to the evolutionary scenario.. . Danger no. 5: The Doctrine of God’s Incarnation is Undermined . The incarnation of God through His Son Jesus Chr"

Put the ticks in a cup with Clorox (you'll be sure to kill them) and have some tweezers handy so you can reach farther than your fingers can.. After you have them all out give her a bath with Anti Flea shampoo, after she's dry and better get a mix of part water and part white vinegar and with a cotton ball dab inside her ears. She'll be hurting a little bit, but the vinegar also helps her get rid of ear mites, which in combination to ticks could be making her life and ears miserable.

On Effexor, I feel so much better.  . . Also, if you become nervous about potential side effects of Effexor, be careful about stopping the medication.  Effexor has some serious withdrawal symptoms.  I recently changed my dose from 150mg to 75mg a day and it took me one month to complete the change....and I still had some symptoms.  . . I think your best bet is to stick with the drug.

Rabbits have very thin, delicate skin and if the dye seeps through it, it could cause the animal to die. Also, it could cause lasting effects on their liver and kidneys as well.

328356,U0,328356_17,1.0,17,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Most Americans are illiterate in English to start with, and seem incapable of spelling the simplest words or constructing even a semi-grammatical sentence.

328356,Q0,328356_7,0.6666666666666666,7,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Because Americans are selfish trouble makers who only think of themselves. Americans believe, or at least all those i know, that all the world should know English just so they don't have to learn to speak another language. We say that America is multiculturaled, but they still try to force their way on everyone, just look at what is happening in Iraq!!. . Again i don't mean to generalize, this is just an observation made by an American."
328356,Q0,328356_8,1.0,8,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"I think it's because they don't feel the need to learn another language, they take for granted, that english is ""the universal language"" so why should they bother to learn another one. Also, americans have a tendancy to think (a little like us in Canada) that people have to live their way (not the way around): it's pretty rare to see an American arriving in another country and try to learn basics phrases to show they appreciate the hospitality of the country they're in. ""I speak english so speak english"""
328356,Q0,328356_9,0.3333333333333333,9,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,What gives you the idea that they can speak English. You obviously have never heard their Prime Minister speak.

328356,Q0,328356_5,1.0,5,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Because in many other countries, it's necessary to speak more than one language, primarily because of the border proximities.  For example, I know many people in Belgium who are fluent in English, Flemish, French, Spanish, German and Italian.  That's because they learn them early in life in order to communicate effectively with their neighbors.  Additionally, English is known as the ""language of business"" around the world."
328356,Q0,328356_6,1.0,6,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"For one thing, we don't need to speak any other language than English to get by in our daily lives.  All Americans speak it.  It's not like some other countries where different languages are  spoken in different areas and you need to know them to communicate.  Also, some Americans feel that, even when traveling abroad, they don't need to brush up on any of the native tongue before they go because other countries teach English as a second language.  While this may be true in some areas, English isn't as prevalent a language as many Americans assume.  I've stated this before, but even though English is taught in the schools of another country doesn't automatically mean the citizens of said country are fluent in English.  I know people who took Spanish here for years in school, live in areas with high hispanic populations, and still can't speak Spanish.  While Americans don't really need to learn another language, I think it's good to learn some of the basics of one if you're traveling to a country where the people speak it.  I know from experience that the people you speak to in what little of their language you might know are appreciative that you're attempting it."
328356,Q0,328356_20,0.6666666666666666,20,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Because Americans dont have to speak anything but english. If there is anything close to a universal language it is english. We don't have to interact with people who speak other languages on a regular basis. People do what they have to do to get by. In Europe and Africa, you have to speak a few languages in the US that's not the case."
328356,Q0,328356_0,1.0,0,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Foreign language isn't given as much priority in US schools as it's given in other countries, I think.  There are some elementary schools where students have an opportunity to learn French or Spanish from a young age, but most students don't get the chance to study a foreign language until at least middle school (around age 12) or more often high school (age 14-17).  From what I've heard, many other countries start their children out with learning other languages from their earliest school days, so they have a much stronger foundation for learning languages and a lot more time to become proficient than American kids.  Right or wrong, foreign language just isn't given as much emphasis here as it is elsewhere."
328356,Q0,328356_1,1.0,1,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"I agree with the other answers: we're a very big country where almost everyone speaks english, so we don't feel we need to learn another language. I do admire Europeans who speak 5-6 languages, seemingly without effort. I think we should be more multi-lingual, but you have to remember in Europe for example, France, Spain, Germany, and England are like 4 seperate states here."
328356,Q0,328356_2,1.0,2,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Angel, I am afraid it is because we Americans basically too lazy to take the time and exert the effort it takes to make it happen. I am embarrassed because of it. We think others should learn english so they can communicate with us and if they don't, well shame on them."
328356,Q0,328356_3,1.0,3,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"because english is the international language and its Americans first language, so they might think they don't need to thinking that they r at the top of the world but actually its a shame for them to know only one language and its a big credit dat other countries know more than one language. The Americans who take the effort of learning Spanish, French or other languages definitely shud be proud just like other country ppl shud be proud as they know more dan one language & the americans who just knows english & dont wana know sum other language shud be ashamed of themselves"
328356,Q0,328356_16,1.0,16,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Because most don't have to.. . You can travel for 5,000 miles, Florida to Alaska, and not need any other language.. . And nearby foreign nations' touristy areas also are quite anglophone-friendly."
328356,Q0,328356_14,1.0,14,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"The second language in most other countries is English.  Americans haven't had a NEED to know another one.. . Something else to consider:  Check out technical terms in almost any other language.  Guess what?  The HAVE to use English terms because most technology COMES from the USA and rather than just ""make up"" some new phrase, it's easier for them to just accept the ""American"" word(s)."

328356,Q0,328356_10,0.6666666666666666,10,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"I think you're stereotyping them too much. I'm sure if you go to any country, the Majority of People will still be only able to speak their native language, with the exception of places like Switzerland which are multi lingual right from the start.. Having said that though, I think perhaps one of the reasons why English has become a global language is because of a basic stubbornness and refusal by us native speakers to learn anyone elses language.. I CAN speak two languages though. (English and Japanese)"
328356,Q0,328356_11,0.3333333333333333,11,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,Reminds me of an old joke.... . What do you call a person who speaks many languages? A polyglot.. . What do you call a person who speaks two languages? A bilingual.. . What do you call a person who speaks only one language? An American.
328356,Q0,328356_21,1.0,21,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Unfortunately, it mostly boils down to the fact that our country is large and fairly separated from any other ""non-English"" countries, except for Mexico.  The entirety of Europe, for example, fits inside the area of the US easily, and there are many, MANY languages in that continent whereas there's really only English in the US.  I'm an American and I do speak another language, incidentally, but I had to take and make the effort to do so and learn it (but I love being bilingual)."
328356,Q0,328356_18,1.0,18,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,"Why indeed?  Is it because they are lazy and stupid?  . Probably not... . It's probably just because they have not been exposed to many foreign languages.  However, many people (at my school) can respect the languages of French and Spanish; this is probably because of similarities and of the closeness of these languages (Mexico to the south, Canada to the north).. However, they don't deal so well with Asian languages, as I've found;  I've tried Japanese on them, and it doesn't stick...  Although they show some enthusiasm in trying to ask me how to say this and that in Chinese (my primary language), I don't think that they are really interested.. The differences between the Asian languages and the European languages are just too big for most Americans to accept.. Hope this helps (though it probably just confuses you more)"
328356,Q0,328356_19,0.6666666666666666,19,Why are most Americans only able to speak English?,because most school districts over here don't start offering another language until high school.  european countries teach english beginning in primary school.

Throughout human history, it is common to link God and government, so that this tradition persists today, even though we claim to have moved away from the divine right to rule or to separate church and state. Human beings inherently put leaders on a pedestal, so whether or not we have royalty, we will make royalty of celebrities, judges, presidents or whomever else we perceive as being in power whether elected or chosen by God.   . .

4145856,U0,4145856_0,1.0,0,Why are Mexicans the only immigrants people notice?,I know there are a lot of immigrants that are not white.  The reason people focus on Mexicans is because they are trying to use racism to get their own way with immigration laws.  Also Mexicans make up the majority of immigrants to the united states and they are relatively well organized when it comes to protesting.  This makes them more of a threat to the white American way of life.

You ask why they are the only ones being noticed. Because they get all of these handouts and demand things they have no right to and then expect us to welcome them with open arms while insulting us.  That is why people hate Mexicans and that is why they are the ones who get noticed mostly.  You tell people to get a book, gain some knowledge.  Take your own advice.  You are in dire need of a history lesson.  That is another thing that offends Americans.  Stupid criminals saying that they were here first, that is the most ridiculous thing ever said.

4145856,Q0,4145856_26,1.0,26,Why are Mexicans the only immigrants people notice?,Part of the problem is that the majority of those coming in illegally are from Mexico (1/6 of their entire population is here right now).  While we have several nationalities that become citizens each year most of the other nationalities come here legally following the correct process to come here.. . We need people to respect our laws and they will be welcome here with open arms.  If you think our laws are to strict look at Mexico's and tell me there is not a double standard.

4145856,Q0,4145856_20,1.0,20,Why are Mexicans the only immigrants people notice?,"I think there is a lot of racism and resentment against Mexicans in this country because so many of them have migrated and are now making huge impacts : most services, for example when you call your bank, have a choice for Spanish; many Mexican immigrants now have businesses and are heavily represented in the construction trade, as well as other trades - painting, plumbing, etc.  Many are now entering politics and are holding offices.. . So, I believe Mexicans are the most vocal and visible immigrants which is why they bear the brunt of the racism, not to mention the great numbers of Mexicans who have crossed the borders illegally."

You are the ignorant one to even state this!  No, we are NOT ALL IMMIGRANTS!  Somewhere down the ancestry line, yes, we all had immigrant ancestors, but no, those of us born here are NOT immigrants.  This has been explained in this forum so many times by now that I cannot believe you are still coming up with this BS.  My dear, I think that you are the one who had better open up your eyes!  And, the reason Mexicans are the main illegal immigrants that get noticed is because they are the largest group of immigrants and also because they recently drew the most attention to themselves with their May1st marches and demonstrations and protests - by doing this, they LITERALLY DEMANDED TO BE NOTICED!

4145856,Q0,4145856_23,1.0,23,Why are Mexicans the only immigrants people notice?,"The Mexicans are noticed more because they are the ones that are screaming equal rights for all, even though they are here illegally.  We have illegals from other countries here, but they are more or less quiet because of fear of being returned to their countries.   Mexicans believe they should regain back the land that was taken from them in the Spanish/American war.  If they really want to be here and work, live a good life, then why are they so afraid of going the proper route to gain entrance into the United States?  . . We all come from immigrate families.  Some have been here for generations, others a few years; but here legally.   I don't think many Americans would be against the Mexican so much, if the Mexicans would come in the legal way.  But, since they come in the illegal ways, that's what makes most Americans against them being here.  . . They have broken the laws, why should they get handed a silver platter?  Most Mexicans get 10,000$, a home, and a job from our government.  What ticks me off is this:  Our government taxes us out the arse and will not give those Americans that apply for disability the money, yet they will hand out money to the illegals, to countries that really don't appreciate the ""hand out"".. . This current administration has gotten us so far in debt, it will take generations to come to get us in the black.  That's if we are even still a nation at that time.. . I know I sort of got off your question, but it still comes down to the Mexican and others that are here illegally that has helped pull our nation down.   Soon our nation will fall from within as many other countries are waiting to happen.. . We were a 'super power' but not any more.  We have lost a lot of allies over this current administrations decision.  Why?  Because it has lied time and time again to not only the American people but to the world.   Liars are NOT well liked now are they?"

4145856,Q0,4145856_8,1.0,8,Why are Mexicans the only immigrants people notice?,"For some reason, the Mexicans on this board seem to be the only illegal immigrants coming forward.  I haven't seen any one say they were from anywhere else.  . . We know not all the illegal immigrants are from Mexico, and we know our ancestors all - legally- came from somewhere else.  I don't see what that has to do with not wanting to pay subsidies for the education and health care of poor people coming in from another country in violation of our immigration limits.  Our own children's education in Southern California, for example, is now substandard.  Hospitals that have to give health care to those who can't pay are going out of business and the cost of their health care is being spread amongst the rest of us.  Because of that, 40% of Americans can't afford health insurance, it is so expensive.. . I am opposed to illegal immigration because poor people use more services than they pay into the system in taxes, even if they pay all taxes, which in general they do not.  That is why there are legal limits on immigration.  People who come under those limits are welcome.  Those who don't are stealing from taxpayers and stealing the chance for a decent education from our children.. . You are young and have never had to plan for your children's education while also trying to set aside money for retirement when you can no longer work.  When you have done that yourself, I think you will understand what we mean.  Mind you, if you are rich, unlike most of us, the issue may never hit you.  But that will only mean you are ingnorant of the problem, not that it doesn't exist."

4145856,Q0,4145856_5,1.0,5,Why are Mexicans the only immigrants people notice?,"Immigration and people's attitudes toward it changed after World War II.  While many ""white"" immigrants were still coming in, they pretty much stuck to their burroughs and for the most part integrated into American society.  They picked up English quickly because they made it a priority, and before they learned enough English they only associated with people of their own kind... actually even after they learned English they still just associated with people of their own kind.  Mexicans, however, seem to stick out like a sore thumb.  A large part of that is because of the sheer number of recent immigrants (recent meaning within 15-20 years)... while the rest of America has become somewhat integrated and homogeneous (at least on the surface), Mexicans are still in that awkward stage that most immigrant groups were in 75 years ago.. . However, maybe the biggest reason Mexican immigrants get so much attention is the fact that we share a border with them.  Sure, we also share a border with Canada... but Canada is a developed nation with citizens who like it there.  Mexico, on the other hand, is a sh1t hole... I don't care how much they love it there, they gotta admit that they left because it is a third world country.  Sure, people jump the Canadian border all the time... but nowhere near the numbers that come from the south -- and to make the gap between the comparison even bigger, those coming from the north probably went to high school and speak English, which means they're 90% integrated right there no matter what color their skin is.. . Now, don't get me wrong... I love immigrants.  Everyone I'm related to, aside from my little sister, is an immigrant.  Some of them are legal, some are not. The fact is that immigrants fill a void in the American economy that Americans don't want to fill.  I was born in the US... I just graduated college and I'm looking for a job... are you shocked that I'm not applying for jobs to pick oranges or clean motel rooms?  Not that immigrants are second-class citizens (they're not citizens at all, in fact), but I guess you can call it social entropy... those who are not yet integrated into society are forced to take the jobs that nobody else wants.  However, this also makes them necessary.  There's no way a carton of Florida OJ would cost less than $4 if citizens had to be paid minimum wage to pick and process the oranges... and that's IF you can find citizens who want to do that.  Even most American homeless people either wouldn't do it or they'd seriously mess it up (mental illnesses are highly common among the homeless population, and that doesn't mesh well with a 9-5).  Just look at unemployment rates in US cities.... an illegal immigrant can come into almost any US city and have a job by the end of the week, so how can there be any excuse for an American citizen to be without a job?  No, they aren't taking jobs away from us... we just don't want those jobs.. . Anyway, this has become a rant.  My point is that Mexicans get all the attention because they are the most highly visible and universally recognized immigrant group today.  The Germans went through it, the Irish went through it, the Italians went through it... now it's the Mexicans' turn.  The key to getting through this rite of passage is integration. This doesn't mean at all that they have to lose their Mexican identity, but they have to adapt to American customs, and the biggest obstacle is learning the language and becoming literate, even though many may not even be very literate in their native language.  And they have to not be so proud of overpopulating the country... overpopulation is not good no matter who you are, unless you WANT the US to turn into the Mexico you left.. . Oh, and I want to add that a huge strike against Mexicans in general, not just immigrants, is the contempt many hold for territories that once belonged to Mexico... as you sta"

751,Q0,751_10,1.0,10,Why does america claim they have freedom of religon?,"This comes from the legal profession giving the wrong interpretation of the 1st amendment.  If you read it correctly, the restraint is on the State to leave the churches alone.  No mention is made of saying the Churches cannot partake in politics.  The founders just wanted to be sure there would not be a State Religion to which all must belong and support."

2849580,U0,2849580_0,1.0,0,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,"The law does not save us, faith does. Faith does not make the law invalid. We obey the law because of our faith."
2849580,Q0,2849580_1,0.3333333333333333,1,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,I did an entire write up on this entire subject.. . http://tinyurl.com/e5ekj
2849580,Q0,2849580_2,1.0,2,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,"Nola is right in her answer. We keep the law in faith. The Law doesn't save us; it just points out sin. We're saved by grace, abiding willingly in his law."
2849580,Q0,2849580_3,1.0,3,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,"It means that our faith, given as a gift from God, establishes the Mosiac law given in the Old Testament during the exodus fo Egypt to the promise land.  Let's go through a couple steps.. The law was created for man to realize what sin was and how it was separation from Him.  Only Jesus was able to keep the law, since He was not born into sin, which occured through the generations.  Jesus, on Calvary, fulfilled the law's requirement for blood atonement and sacrifice.  (read Hebrews 1-8, this was help better understand this).. In Romans 6, it states that we are no longer under the law but under grace.  Only those who are no under the Holy Spirit's guidance, and accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior are under the law, which condemns mankind for their actions.  Christians are under God's grace, which allows people to walk in truth through faith.  Bible says that faith, through grace, is a gift from God.  grace and faith must coincide to understand the truth."
2849580,Q0,2849580_4,1.0,4,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,"There were some misunderstandings between the Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome. Worried Jewish Christians were asking Paul,""Does faith wipe out everything Judaism stands for? Does it cancel our Scriptures, put an end to our customs, declare that God is no longer working through us?"" (This is essentially the question used to open chapter 3)""Absolutely not!""says Paul. When we understand the way of salvation through faith, we understand the Jewish religion better. We know why Abraham was chosen, why the law was given, and why God worked patiently with Israel for centuries. Faith does not wipe out the Old Testament. Rather, it makes God's dealings with the Jewish people understandable. In chapter 4, Paul will expand on this theme(see also 5:20,21;8:3,4;13:9,10; Galations 3:24-29; and 1 Timothy 1:8 for more on this concept).. I hope that I was able to help you understand this verse. I know that sometimes certain things in the Bible tend to be confusing, but you keep on studying and asking questions, you will understand a lot more. It also helps to read the verse from different versions. Some Bibles are easier to understand than others."
2849580,Q0,2849580_5,1.0,5,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,"Good question! Some people claim that we are no longer under the Law, but under Grace. But this verse would seem to indicate that the Law is established by faith.. . ""Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."". . I think it means we're still under the Law, and we're screwed if God decides to punish us for no longer following it to the letter."
2849580,Q0,2849580_6,0.6666666666666666,6,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,"The word nullify means to put end to, to make null:invalidate,to counteract the force or effectiveness. we don't want to put end to this faith but uphold it"

2849580,Q0,2849580_8,0.3333333333333333,8,what does Romans 3:31 mean?,"It means it is time for you to get a public library card and start reading about art, music, culture, engineering and other things to improve your mind than focus on mythology."

4047638,U0,4047638_0,1.0,0,Why are people sticking to Atheism?,"Probably because of people like you who are so full of their own convictions that they must shove them down everybody's throat.  I have yet to hear of atheists who have killed, maimed, tortured, stolen, invaded, forcfully converted a people in the name of the Non-God as has been done for hundred of years by the so called faithful who were spreading the truth! Oh, and no thanks on the info.  As Madonna recently sang ""...i've heard it all before...."""
4047638,Q0,4047638_18,0.6666666666666666,18,Why are people sticking to Atheism?,"Because if there were a God that watches over us, why would innocent children go to bed hungry, have no home or clothes, become victims of molestation, die in the 9/11 incident? Why would innocent minors SUFFER for hours before dying?Why would women get abused by their husbands? Why would God give too much to some and nothing to others? Okay and to go on with all of this, I have argued this before with Christians and I get the response ""When God closes a door, he opens a window"". I do believe the victims of hurricane Katrina (Who are still trying to put their lives back together) would rather have left that door open no matter how things go for them later. You asked, I answered!!!"

Atheist believe that there is no God and they are sure that there is no God.. . Agnostics believe that we cannot possibily know whether there is or isn't a God.. .

4047638,Q0,4047638_11,0.6666666666666666,11,Why are people sticking to Atheism?,"I am religious. Sometimes I feel sorry for atheists as they must feel lonely at times. Other than that, they are much better than those religious fanatics who don't mind killing in the name of God.. . Second point, I have recently been to a devil's abode... I mean they pray to God every single day but all their creativity is directed towards making other's lives miserable. They lie, cheat, steal... in fact they are all the sins personified. What's more, when it suits them, they make fun of God-fearing people and at other occassions they flaunt their religious ways. They even misguide others about religious rituals and put them in harm's way.. . My mom was never a staunch believer but some events strengthened her faith. My father, on the other hand, is an atheist. Still I prefer people like them who may be atheists, may not flaunt their faith but are scared of doing something wrong. God! Please grant that we always follow your ways."

4047638,Q0,4047638_13,0.3333333333333333,13,Why are people sticking to Atheism?,"It sounds as if you are still a child. Once you grow up you might realise that that was not a way to behave. You might also realise that its not very smart to insult the people you want to convince with logic as they will imedietly have a negative disposition towards anything you say. . And might very well come to the conclusion that some dumb kid is hardly going to be the one with truly ""logical"" arguments.. . My advice: grow up, be nice to people like your religion told you to and live in harmony with everyone. . And to your cowardice point:. We atheists walk through life alone; we can't put trust into a supreme being watching over us. We are responsible for everything we do and have to handle everything on our own. There is no ""Deo volente"" to justify things outside our control, just our own inability. So don't call us cowards for choosing to bear our own cross. It is you who let someone else die for YOUR sins.. . . EDIT:. to anypurpose:. You do see the flaw in your logic don't you? I mean please tell me you are smarter than what you wrote there.. Because according to that reasoning I can say that George Bush doesn't exist since I only saw him on tv and never in the flesh, my neighbours parents don't exist since I havent met them... gosh how can someone call that logic or wonder why noone takes them and their belief serious.. And while we are at it. Religious beliefs are called that for a reason: you have to ""believe"" you can't prove. If it was otherwise you wouldnt be a believer. Words have meanings for a reason. Even if you might think otherwise."

Way to set an example, guys.  If you want people to take you an your faith seriously, give the name calling a rest.   I may be a masochist, but I'm not a big enough masochist to join any faith where some followers think it's well within their rights to call people who believe or believe differently stupid and self-centered.  . .

I do not believe in god, and it has never been proven. What you use for proof is terribly subjective and circumstantial. I have never found your ""proof"" too apply to me. I do not believe in god at all. I never will. I see religion as the corruption of society. If you disagree with me, that's fine. That's my opinion and I am not threatened by yours at all. I am glad that you are somewhat comfortable in your lifestyle. I do find it sad though that you have to challenge others to affirm your own beliefs for yourself. that is sad."

They don't believe in an afterlife, so all they have (they think) is this short life on Earth. And if that's all you're going to have then it's easy to get in a ""me, me, me"" mode.

We have created, in a lab, all the building blocks needed for life from common chemicals. Sorry your argument doesn't hold up. You could have said that God created life using natural means.
