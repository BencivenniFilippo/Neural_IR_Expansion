1167882,U0,1167882_0,1.0,0,'What are the different kinds of bad things people do and why do they do them?',"Sin is the affect of an earlier problem.Sin occurs mainly after temptation has been acted upon by our spirit and body.Sin is something that if not repented of will lead to death not in the bodily sense alone but spiritual as well.""The second death"" as it is called is what punishment is aquired for the acummulation of unrepented sin.Actually if a person is baptized into Christ and has repented and living the Christian life as best they can there will still be sin.Thing is we then have the privledge to ask forgiveness of sins as long as we try not to sin which is what repent actually broken down means.To turn from sin.Sin actually is no worse than another sin for instance Christ only really spoke of one and that is blasphemy and it is the worst of all.Sexual sin is a biggy but only because when you are baptized into Christ's body then you have the holy spirit within you.So having sex you are involving the holy spirit which lives inside of you which is definetly not good.Sin for the most part is equal.For instance some so called christians say that homosexuality is worse than other sins but in reality if I looked upon a woman sexually it is no worse than if a man looks at another man that way or vice versa.Just remember that sin is an act not something we are born with as calvinists and catholics believe.A baby that cannot walk talk or have sex cannot sin!Therefore it doesnt need baptism as a baby as they say besides a baby cannot confess Christ as Lord nor repent of sins for it has none.Hope this helps"

Mark 10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. Romans 13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God..  . This is by no means a complete list but all of these are sins, but all a Christian has to do is ask for forgiveness, believe you are forgiven and realize this was why Jesus Christ had to die, for your unbelief in God's word.

As for how they get put on, I'm not 100% sure, but the spread your lips really far apart, and put this kinda weird stuff *you can't feel it* and stick the brackets on that *in case you don't know what brackets are, their almost box things that keep the wires on* they but some weird blue UV light over it for a long time *your lips get reaaaaly sore* and that solidifies the braces on. They then stick the wire in and close the brackets *at least on mine* As for if they hurt, my orthodontist said you could be sore for a couple days,but I wasn't. And you get used to them faster than you think they will.. . Don't be afraid!!!!. . P.S. These people who say it hurts a ton, or are really uncomfortable are lying!!!!"

Housekeepers are occasionally portrayed in literature as being the most senior staff member and as even making recommendations for the hiring of the butler.. . In modern houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as Majordomo, Butler Administrator, Staff Manager, Estate Manager and Head of Household Staff are sometimes given.. . The word ""butler"" derives from the Old French ""bouteillier"", (meaning ""cup bearer""), from ""bouteille"", (""bottle""). The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages (which in ancient times represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.). . In Britain the butler was originally a middle ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries the butler gradually became the usually senior male member of a household's staff (in the very grandest households there was sometimes a house steward senior to the butler into the 19th century). Butlers used to always be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.. . The earliest literary mention of a butler is probably that of the man whose release from prison was predicted by Joseph in the biblical account of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the Pharaoh's servants.. . In London there remains only one hotel which offers a private butler service, The Lanesborough Hotel."

Make sure your flame is low, you don't want to char the outside of them before the inside is done.

2382487,Q0,2382487_13,1.0,13,'What should I do if I haven't started my period in about 6 months?',"OK the baby answer is getting old.  . . If no baby on the way - then yes it is a hormone, but no ""the pill"" is not the cure all.. . The reality is that most women who have period problems usually have one of two issues.  1.) low body fat  or 2.) low fat consumption.  Hormones are made by fats ingested in the body.  If the wrong type or amount of fats are being ingested, then the body has a hard time regulating the hormones produced.  In addition often times severe stress will cause this as the hormone precursors are pushed into what is known as the adrenal cascade - this is where the body uses the hormone precursors usually used for estrogen and progesterone and begins using them to assist with stress managment hormones.  . . A simple adrenal stess profile - a urinalysis any doctor can order, but usually not done by any one other than a doc practicing functinal medicine - will let you know how your hormones are working.  . . Regardless - if it is a fat intake problem - I would recommend supplementing the diet with some fish oil (if not preg.) or with flax seed oil.  Both are wonderful for a host of conditions and support normal hormone production.. . As always, a non-expensive, simple blood test by any doc can rule out the more serious issues - and they should be ruled out.. . Best of luck"
2382487,Q0,2382487_14,1.0,14,'What should I do if I haven't started my period in about 6 months?',See your gyn doctor.

If you are under a lot of stress or are extremely physically active your body might stop having periods.  Also, if you are on birth control check what type you are on.

Some women go a long time without menstrating natuarally but if you're not one of them something is definitely wrong.  Are you extremely underweight?  Could you be pregnant?  Have you just recovered from an illness?  Are you nursing?  Are you on birth control?  If you answered yes to any of these you might be ok.  Otherwise, please take a day off work and go to the doctor.  You probably have a hormonal problem that can be easily corrected with medication.

3396066,Q0,3396066_8,0.6666666666666666,8,'How do airplanes stay up in the sky?',"Jet engines are DESIGNED to fly at high altitudes.  They get better economy.

3396066,Q0,3396066_5,1.0,5,'How do airplanes stay up in the sky?',"Number one, the higher you go, the smoother the air is.  It is also because the higher you go, you cover more distance because the arc of assent and descent covers greater distance.  There is less structural stress on an airplane at a higher altitude.  The temperature is very cold, so jet engines perform better and more efficiently.  Finally, the higher you go, the less congested the air space is."

3396066,Q0,3396066_6,0.6666666666666666,6,'How do airplanes stay up in the sky?',I think the reason is planes can go faster at high altitudes due to the air been thinner. I think its called the slipstrem
3396066,Q0,3396066_1,1.0,1,'How do airplanes stay up in the sky?',"At higher altitude the air is thinner and there is less drag on the airframe, the engines also consume vastly less fuel. As the air gets colder the engines run more efficiently until you get to about 36,000 feet where the air stops cooling down. There's also a change over between your ground speed being limited by indicated air speed and mach number. Below that height, somewhere around 28,000 feet, as you climb at constant air speed your ground speed inscrease, above that height as you climb at constant mach number your ground speed decreases... and so does your indicated air speed which ultimately limits your altitude as your indicated air speed at maximum mach number starts to approach your minimum air speed without high lift devices.. . Passanger comfort and avoiding weather are important, but efficiency is king, that's why 747s were capable of M0.92 but more modern jets tend to cruise at M0.8 and max out at M0.875 or below. They can't back off the mach number much without reducing their ability to reach the most effieient cruising altitudes."
3396066,Q0,3396066_0,1.0,0,'How do airplanes stay up in the sky?',"The air is much thinner at high altitudes, and the engines on long-range jets are designed to operate at their best efficency in thin air. Also, since the air is so much thinner at high altitude the resistance against the aircraft (drag) is much reduced, meaning they jet burns less fuel for the same effect. This translates into much better fuel economy, leaving more money per mile for the airline. Also, airliners cruise at different altitudes with a minimum 500' of separation. This makes for a lot of different ""lanes"" for them to use, and makes it safer for many planes to be in the air at the same time, reducing the chance of collision."
3396066,Q0,3396066_3,1.0,3,'How do airplanes stay up in the sky?',"The primary reason is to fly above the weather that would be encountered en route at lower levels. Passenger comfort, safety, separation from other aircraft, & depending on direction of flight, to take advantage of the higher wind speeds that are available at the higher altitudes."
3396066,Q0,3396066_12,1.0,12,'How do airplanes stay up in the sky?',"yeah, the air is thinner up there so there is less air resistence and the plane is more fuel efficiant"

Parts of Noahs Ark have been sighted on Mount Ararat and bits of tarred gofer wood which the Ark was made from have been dated and found to be 5000 years old,this is proof that the bible is true, and there is more; Look at the Moabite Stone.The original can be seen in the Louvre Museum in Paris France. The writing tells of the rebellion of King Mesha of Moab against Israel. This  event is also reported in the Bible (2 Kings1:1:3:4-27) The Pool of Siloam and the entrance of a 1,749 foot  -long(533 meter-long)water tunnel in Jerusalem. Many modern-day visitors to Jerusalem have waded through this tunnel. It's existance is further proof that the Bible is true, The Bible explains that King Hezekiah had this tunnel built over2,500 years ago to protect his water supply from an invading army,-(2Kings20:20; 2Chronicles32:2-4,30)At the British Museum a visitor can see the Neabonidus Chronicle. It describes the fall of ancient Babylon, even as the Bible also does.(Daniel5:30,31)The Bible says that Belshazzar was then King of Babylon.  In fact, at one time all known writings said that Nabonidus was Babylon's last king. So some who said the Bible is not true claimed that Belshazzar never existed and that the Bible was wrong. But in recent years ancient writings have been found that identified Belshazzar as a son of Nabonidus and coruler with his father in Babylon at the time. Yes, the Bible really is true, as so many examples prove.Yet the Bible does not contain only true history.Everything it says is true, Even when it touches on matters of science, it is marvelously accurate.

We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

4372730,Q0,4372730_43,0.6666666666666666,43,'Why is the bible hard to understand?',"That is certainly more than one question.  To answer your first question: the Bible does make sense, and it is harmonious from cover to cover.  The problem arises when people try to force the Bible to fit their beliefs, instead of adjusting their beliefs to agree with Bible teachings.  For example, some want to say that the Bible says nothing about homosexuality because that fits their desires.  However, the Bible does indeed speak on the subject, and is consistent throughout.  When a person's beliefs go contrary to Bible teachings, what should he or she do?  Trust the Bible.. . Now, as to physical evidence...archaeologists have indeed found evidence as stated in the Bible.  In fact, there are things in the Bible that archaelogists and other scientists doubted...until they found it.  Whether it is the city of Ninevah, or certain kings stated in the Bible, to wells and other locales, the Bible has been found to be accurate.. . Your statement about evolution doesn't really hold water.  Even though bones and fossils have been found, even Darwin admitted that his theory has so many holes in it that it couldn't stand up to intense scrutiny.  The problem is that scientists refuse to apply scientific principles to their theory.  If a scientist finds data that contradicts a hypothesis, then by rights the scientist must discard the hypothesis and formulate a new one based on the new data.  However, with evolution, they refuse to discard it and instead try to force the data to fit the hypothesis.  In a way, evolution is their faith, rather than a science.. . Thus, instead of believing in ""religion"", trust in the Bible and speak with those who live their lives according to its principles, and those who are students of its teachings, rather than students of the philosophies of men."

4372730,Q0,4372730_32,1.0,32,'Why is the bible hard to understand?',"The Bible makes perfect sense if you understand the reason it was written.  It was not just one man sitting down and saying, I'm going to write this and everyone will believe me.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, and some were written by several people together.  Hense the names of the books.  e.g.the book of John, Peter, Galatians...They were named after the people that wrote them.  And since no one has exactly the same outlook on things as another person, all the details aren't exactly the same.  Let's say you and I were watching Jesus's crucifiction.  You're at the front of the crowd, throwing stones, and I'm at the back praying for Him to leave this world and join His Father.  From where you're standing, it looks one way.  But it's different where I'm at.  In the end, the simple fact is, He was still nailed to a cross and burned, along with two other men.  . . You also have to think about the language barrier.  You and I may speak English, and read our Bibles in English.  But the first Bibles were not written that way.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, from a different region of the world.  So, the Bible you know today has been translated and retranslated so many times, some of the words are not what they ere originally.  . . You can't expect the Bible to conform to how you think.  It was written thousands of years ago.  Things change over time.  But instead, try to put yourself in the mode of thinking that those people were in when they wrote it.  All they knew was what they saw, heard, felt, and experienced for them selves.  Than they wrote it down.  Just the same as celebrities and athletes do now.  You just have to look at it through a different pair of eyes for a little while.  Then you'll understand it."

There are many proofs of things mentioned in the Bible. There is nothing ""magical"", it is the Holy Bible not Harry Potter, There are iracles.. Don't just  look here and there, read complete chapters.  That's how you begin to see the thread.  Even though there were many writers I believe the Bible is the inspired word of God.  When you really get into it you will see it's not contradictory at all.  Ask Him to show you the Truth.  I read five Psalms every day and one chapter in Proverbs.  I read other books of the Bible too but that's my way and Ithink I've learned a lot.  Don't know if you were honestly looking for an answer or just wanting to rile some Christians, but I hope I've helped."

1944018,Q0,1944018_10,0.6666666666666666,10,'Why can't young people vote?',"When the founding fathers began drawing up the country, they wanted to formulate a republic more than a democracy. In a democracy, as in the time of ancient Greece, everyone had a say and could stand up and speak for themselves during large meetings. In an entire country, rather than just a city state, this idea is impossible and impractical. Therefore they developed a system of people voting in order say who they wanted to represent their best intrests. The founding fathers, though, where white protestant males of upper and middle class status, and thus feared the what they considered to be the uneducated and uninformed masses. That is why they developed the electoral college, so that even if a candiate won the popular vote, they would not necessarily become president. If the founding fathers feared the views of adults of their own time, they would certainly not have approved of the views of their youth, or today's youth for that matter. That is why teenagers cannot vote."

The reason for that is that most people under the age of eighteen AREN'T responsible enough OR informed enough to be trusted with such a responsibility.. Personally, I don't think a person should be able to vote at eighteen, or even 21.  I think thirty would be a good age....even if it does mean that I'd have to wait five more years to vote!"

3411123,Q0,3411123_2,0.6666666666666666,2,'Why doesn't America accept foreign credentials?',"One major reason is that there are around 200 countries in the world, many of which have different requirements.  Usually, there is a way to get recognition for your education without having to start from the beginning.  For example, physicians from other countries have to take a special exam to be licensed to practice medicine in the U.S."
3411123,Q0,3411123_3,1.0,3,'Why doesn't America accept foreign credentials?',"The US has so many highly educated people here with degrees that are doing odd jobs.  Having a degree doesn't mean you have the necessary experience  required to perform the delegated chores associated with that profession.  EX. as a question.  Would you want a doctor with a degree but no experience operating on your back without an  experienced doctor assisting?  Of course not..    Another situation exists within this society, and that is the other side of the coin... There are so many people  with the same experience already in line for the same profession you are in, that  have the experience being looked for.   They already did their internship and the such (which are required) to be considered,   So..  a masters degree, with internship, is better than a masters degree alone!!!  Besides there are also a lot of faked documents floating around these days that are NOT verifiable... DO THE INTERNSHIP,,Prove yourself  and then   APPLY..."
3411123,E0,3411123_1,0.3333333333333333,1,'Why doesn't America accept foreign credentials?',"There has been news overseas of scandals regarding national exams and the educaional systems in other countries. Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of ""pre-university"" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university."

It gets worse, you can be credited/certified in one State, but not another without ""further"" testing and courses.  Then Standards differ from not just one State to the next, but from one place of higher learning to another.

I doubt it, unless they're desperate for a specific type of professional.. . Each country has different building materials and cultural and natural challenges.

3411123,Q0,3411123_8,1.0,8,'Why doesn't America accept foreign credentials?',"I think maybe the question might be a little off.  In your particular position it might be true but in honesty in lots of positions such as doctors, they will usually be hired quicker than Americans as usually they will work cheaper although still making great wages.  Locally here, a J-1 doctor with no experience will hire in as soon as they enter the country for about 150K per year with another 100k in perks where an American doctor won't even consider an offer like that.  I saw a couple years back an American OBGYN hire in at a company with a 200K sign in bonus, $200K per year salary, 1/2 of the overall money she generated on top of that, $500/month cell phone allowance, and $700/month rental allowance."

Another remedy that wors better and doesn't make you look silly for a week.. is find a man who is the 7th son (meaning he has 6 older brothers) and have him 'rub away' the wart.

My two oldest boys had gotten warts all over their hands and I had a 7th son rub them off. About 6 weeks later, I had forgotten about it and went to take the boys to the doctor to get rid of them before school started, and the youngest one's warts were gone. The oldest didn't believe they'd be gone and they weren't but the youngest did believe. It really works.

Sorry to quote an old song but it is true. So in the grand scheme of things we shouldn't be so serious all the time...yet for our brief moments on this earth so many suffer that it becomes necessary to be serious. So within the scope of a few years time we need to be serious and take the hardship of man seriously. Life appears to be the cheapest commodity on earth. For every soul lost there are a dozen more souls to take its place. So should we care? Should we be serious about all those strangers a thousand miles away who are not related to us? Yes, only if you take your own existence seriously can you value those others. In the US we make such a noise about one life lost in a robbery or a car wreck. We show the grief of parents over a lost child. But remember that those lost lives far away are also precious to those few whose lives they touched. . . So, do we need to lighten up or maybe take ourselves a little more seriously? The universe doesn't care about us, only we can care about us."

You don't want him/her more aggressive, you want it to protect your house.  You must create a bond with your dog, as Pit Bulls make it their life's mission to please their owner.  Understand that all Pit Bulls do not bark.  But if you create a close enough bond with your animal they will not welcome in an intruder.  They will show their teeth, growl and run an intruder away (without biting), they will corner (without biting) an intruder in your house and not allow them to leave until you get there.  An ideal Pit Bull will not do more than that, but are certainly effective.  You don't want a ""maneater""!. . Creat the bond, forget aggressiveness and more importantly read up on the breed.  Unfortunately, too many people acquire Pit Bulls without truly understanding the breed itself.

Once a dog is trained to be aggressive he is not safe to be around.  My sister had bull dogs and thought they should be aggressive and thought it was funny that everyone was scared of them.  She fell and broke her hip and then her dogs were not safe around her as they know they could overpower her.  After one of the 5 attacked her she had to give them to a bull dog rescue.
3971195,Q0,3971195_14,1.0,14,'How can I make my pitbull more aggressive?',Trying to make him more aggressive is why pits have such a bad name.  Talk to a trainer about some protection/guard dog training.  They should be trained by a professional and not you.  You need to go with him when he is trained and learn how to control him afterward.. Good luck
3971195,E0,3971195_13,0.3333333333333333,13,'How can I make my pitbull more aggressive?',"If this is a dog is in a neighborhood setting, I suggest weighing the cons posed by having a dog that is aggressive.  One bite and you could be looking at law suit city.  Even if the bite occurs while someone is breaking in, you could be liable for a dangerous dog.. . Good for your dog to have self preservation and to hide.  Smart dog!!!  Robbers usually know if there is a dog there and will come prepared to eliminate any threat posed by the dog (ie they neutralize the dog with mace, bludgeoning, etc.) or trick it into one room with food and lock it in there and still take your stuff.  I know you want to protect your stuff but you are much better off having a better alarm system or locks or living in a safer part of town.. . Most 1 year old dogs are not mentally mature enough to be guard dogs without professional training.  They gain confidence about their territory and protecting it in the years to come."

These catch the mice inside a box-like structure so you can release them elsewhere, preferably somewhere far from any houses. People usually have mixed results with these. You could also just get regular spring mouse traps. They usually kill the animal instantly, by breaking their spinal cord. Just be sure to check them often.. You also need to understand how the other methods work in order to pick the right one. Rat poison doesn't cause dehydration, but instead it causes internal bleeding, until the animal eventually dies. MAKE SURE TO KEEP THIS AWAY FROM PETS OR LIVESTOCK-- THEY WILL AFFECT THEM THE SAME WAY. and treatment is expensive.  Glue traps work by trapping the animal and waiting for them to starve to death or dehydrate. Can also be harmful for pets. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me."

""How should I witness to someone who belongs to a denomination, who I suspect isn’t trusting the Savior?"". . The most effective way to speak about the issues of eternity to a religious person is not to get sidetracked from the essentials of salvation. Upon hearing a person’s background, we may feel an obligation to speak to issues such as infant baptism, transubstantiation, etc. However, it is wise rather to build on the points of agreement between the Bible and the person’s denomination, such as the virgin birth, the cross, and so on. One point of agreement will almost certainly be the Ten Commandments. They are the key to bringing any religious person to a saving knowledge of the gospel. . . After someone is converted to Jesus Christ, the Bible will come alive and he will be led into all truth by the indwelling Holy Spirit. God’s Word will then give him light, and he will forsake religious tradition as he is led by God. While there are strong biblical arguments that may convince unregenerate people that their church’s traditions contradict Holy Scripture, there is a difficulty. Some religious people hold the teachings of their church to be on a par with, or of greater authority than, Holy Scripture. It is therefore often futile to try to convince them intellectually that their trust should be in the person of Jesus Christ, rather than in their own righteousness or in their church traditions. For this reason we should aim at the conscience, rather than the intellect. Take them through the Law of God (the Commandments) to show that they are condemned despite their works, and strongly emphasize that we are saved by grace, and grace alone, rather than by trusting in our own righteousness or religious traditions. . . If they are open to the gospel, and are interested in what God’s Word says in reference to their church’s teachings, they will listen to Scripture. For example, in Matthew 8:14 we see that Peter (whom the Roman Catholic church maintains was the first pope) was married, as were many of the other apostles (see 1 Corinthians 9:5)."

Romans 10:9 That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. 11 As the Scripture says, ""Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame."" 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, ""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."""

They forget, or usually don't know church history.. . Crash course in early christian history.... . Until 423 there was no ""bible"" or orthodoxy of belief....every little christian group, the Gnostics, Essenes and many others shared different views of who or what Jesus was, and used different versions of Gospels and letters.  . . Constantine ordered that the bishops make a catholic bible (ie broad in interest, appealing to the widest variety )  so they threw out the more contraversial and outrageous bits (and that's saying something !!!) edited and tried to correct inconsistencies with the included bits (and boy, did they miss a lot !!!!) came up with a canon, started persecuting heretic christians and building churches and forging relics with Constantines support.  Phew.. . As the Roman empire collapsed, what was now the Catholic church assumed a power vacuum in Rome and the pope became the de facto ruler of the former Roman Empire.  As literacy level dropped during the Dark Ages, and Latin fell out of common usage, the clergy were the only ones now with ""direct access"" to the word of god, and became incredibly powerful and rich as a result. (Remember, there was no TV back then, and a priest reading gods word to you in a language you didn't understand was a powerful thing). . The Protestant Reformation took place on several fronts with people like Calvin, Luther and Henry VIII reacting to the power and corruption of the papacy.   The Protestant movement has continued to fragment into even more faction ever since.. . However, by definition, they all worship Christ, whatever their docrtrinal differences, so they all practice Christianity.. . . The fact it is all delusion is an answer to a different question"

Killing Zarqawi is the perfect microcosm of the whole war in Iraq.  Heroic soldiers execute with pefection a plan to track down and eliminate Zarqawi.  Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . .

The easy target is people of the same kind and direct the outrage and distrust towards ""them"".  I don't advocate that, just trying to analyze why you may have that perception.. .

'training'. Apparently they can schedule a longer appointment if necessary.. . Also, the idea is that a staff nurse or the doctor will look through the list of patients/appointments at some point and do some minor 'triage'. If anything jumps out then they will call the patient and have them either come in immediately or visit the Emergency Room at a local hospital.. . Personally, I believe that I could describe my symptoms as, ""I just sawed my leg off,"" and my appointment would still be three weeks away!. . But yes, it is kind of 'icky'.... . ME: ""Hello... yes... well, my penis is twice it's normal size and it's grown two ears and some hair on it's head."". . CS: ""Oh yes, we can fit you in on Tuesday, August 5th 2007.

1364894,Q0,1364894_1,1.0,1,'Why do we have to tell customer service/operator about our sickness to make an appointment with a doctor?',"Well, they need to be able to make a decision about how serious it is.

You can be vauge. Instead of telling them that you've been, say, on your period for a month, you can say you're having a ""girly"" problem.. .

1364894,Q0,1364894_3,1.0,3,'Why do we have to tell customer service/operator about our sickness to make an appointment with a doctor?',The customer service people decide which doctor you need to see. Certain doctors only deal with certain issues. Also the doctor can do some research beforehand to find out what kind of illness you have.. . I think that people who know were they need to go should have direct access to a doctor. Those who are stupid need customer service to guide them to the right doctor.
1364894,Q0,1364894_2,0.3333333333333333,2,'Why do we have to tell customer service/operator about our sickness to make an appointment with a doctor?',"Just tell the operator their are HEPPA laws that prevent you from discussing any med. reasons from answering these questions.

If you are not using it as a trademark yourself, I can't see what the problem is.. . On all these ""infringement"" questions, common sense and your own experience must rule the day.  Haven't you seen words and phrases, names even, that are used in normal newspapers, magazine articles, and books?  People say things like ""I'll go get a Coke.""  If it was illegal to use a trademarked name in that way, we'd never be able to say anything!  . . The basic rule in copyright is that if the ideas are, to your conscious mind, original to you, go ahead and use them.  If you purposely quote someone else, put it in quote marks and attribute it.  But if you just happen to choose the same words someone else in the past has used, that would not be an infringement.  However, if your entire chapter (or even a significant part of it) is word-for-word the same as someone else's, you're going to have trouble convincing a jury that you did not copy.. . Mama always said if you are honest, you don't have to worry about being sued.  That's something of an exaggeration in this modern litigious age, but it's about as good as we've got.

4018891,Q0,4018891_25,1.0,25,'How can I tell if a word or sentence is protected by law?',"All you have to do is google the word, if it comes back copyrighted, then  you have to contact the entity that has the publishing rights of the name. It's a bit tedious, and it might take some time to accomplish, but you're better off doing things legit, than face legal action once their corporate lawyers catch wind of your infraction. Once  you find out who has the legal rights over the name, all you have to do is make a request in writing to use the name. Sometimes they are cool about it and will allow you to use the name for free, the only thing you'll have to do is list that they have authorized it on your book credit's portion. Sometimes they will charge you a fee, but it's usually bereable. Good luck."

There is a lot of information out there and it just depends on the method or modification you want to work with.  It is best that you do the training yourself.  There are training classes everywhere you look if you want to do in that kind of setting to were there are a lot of distractions of other dogs and other people around.  I like to get the basic training done without all the extra distractions.  Once the basics are installed it is wise to go to different places so that the footing is different.  Like a walk down a side walk, walk them through a carpeted area, bare ground, think forest etc.  Also where people and other animals are so that he/she learns to be observant but will not break her training.. . If you want instructions on how to teach him/her to pull a sled start out with, say a wagon pulling a couple of kids or rocks.  I don't think this is what you were looking for cause you didn't say if you had several or just one.. . I myself like the behavior modification rather than the method training.

For basic obedience, I recommend you look at your local library for ""Siberian Huskies for Dummies"" or ""the Dog Whisperer"", both are very helpful books.  If your local library does not have them, you can ask them (usually available on their website) for an interlibrary loan.  . . A good website for husky-specific training tips was mentioned above: http://www.husky-petlove.com/husky_alpha_training.html.  I tried these ideas with my dog and had great results.  . . Some tips:. Huskies cannot be trained to be off a leash.  Period.  . . If you NEVER feed your dog from the table, (s)he will NEVER beg.  . . If you limit food (most Huskies only need 1 cup of dry food twice per day, according to our vet), then you can use food as a great motivator, even if it is just a small morsel of bread or a kibble.  To train your dog to kiss with his nose, you can say ""kiss"" then physically move his nose to contact your cheek, then say ""good boy"" and give a food reward.  After about 5 of these (s)he will be trained.  . . If basic obedience is a problem, make sure you are giving your husky enough exercise.  It makes a huge difference.  . . Good luck."

Since you have a girl you don't have to worry about her spraying the walls around the litter box (a problem we had with my boy).  Just continue to put her in the box when she poops and pees.  Also, put some of her poop in the box the first time to help her. Always leave a little of the previous waste in the box when you empty it to help her remember where to go.  We kept ours in the bathroom so we had one litter box.  If you are going to let her hop around the whole house you will need a litter box in almost every room to begin with so that she can become trained.  Also, you want to be careful that cords are tied up out of her way so that she won't chew on them.  Our bunny chewed the baseboard around our bathroom.  You might want to spray it with bitter apple to keep the bunny from chewing on it or other things that are low.  Good luck and have fun.  If wonderful having a bunny hope around your feet while your in the house."
4473331,Q0,4473331_3,1.0,3,'How can I keep my rabbit inside?',"Actually, there are a lot of considerations to think about when bringing a bunny indoors.  Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their ""business"" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.  I currently have 3 sweet little buns living in my house, and have kept indoor rabbits for years.  . . Hope this helps -- and check out the site listed below for some good reading on the subject!"

3074429,Q0,3074429_7,1.0,7,'How can we learn more about Islam and the people who follow it?',"Live with them. Spend time in their culture. Born in Texas, I lived in Iran as a child, for 5 years, up until age 7(1979- Fall of the Shah of Iran, rise of Ayatholla Khomeni). I grew up and watched an Islamic revolution tear a nation apart...or bring it together against a common enemy- depending on your view point. Since I [Americans] was the enemy, it skewed my judgement to think that they were wrong. But, do we not also make outcast those who dont agree with us? First hand experience is my answer at the core."
3074429,E0,3074429_6,1.0,6,'How can we learn more about Islam and the people who follow it?',"By reading the Koran.  Muslims often claim their religion is very close to Christianity.  It is actually diametrically opposed.  They deny the divinity of Jesus.  More important, perhaps, is that the primary focus of Christianity is forgiveness, while the primary focus of Islam is revenge.  Personally the true tenets of Islam make me rather sick.  And I've talked to enough of them in person to know Love is not the basis of that particular religion."
3074429,Q0,3074429_5,1.0,5,'How can we learn more about Islam and the people who follow it?',"I believe the first step would be to realize that, like Christians, there are many, many different groups that would identify themselves as Muslim.  For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Baptists, and even the Branch Davidians in Waco all would consider themselves to be Christian.  . . Realizing that, you would have to consider which group of Muslims (people) you were trying to understand.  Take a good look at their situation.  Their actions, if they are Muslims, that is to say if they are Islamic, should be supported by, or justified by the Koran (the Holy Book of Islam).  . . I think that some peoples actions, commonly attributed to Muslims or Islam, could also be resulting from other factors.  I have read the Koran (in English) and it is mostly very similiar to reading the Bible in that It is a Message or a lesson from or about God.  Jesus is there and the Virgin Mary, too.  Alot of the same stories or themes,   and God, who is the same are in both Books. There are some parts that would seem wrong or strange or even quite different, but mostly, very similar."

This is a free country, Muslims have the right to spread their religion as much as they want. It's a safe and peaceful religion, and they have the right to preach their beliefs as much as any other religion does.. . It's really those extremist Muslims that corrupt the minds of many Americans, like you, who make the American public believe that Islam is a violent religion of suicide bombers and terrorists. Islam is NOT such a religion. Islam strictly condones any violence and acts of terrorism and Hell is the punishment for those people. Islam promotes peace, unity, and respect to everyone, even those who are not Muslims.. . Your question should read, ""How can we stop the spread of EXTREMIST Islam?"". .

And I don't think the majority of the American people do either.. The majoriy of the Muslims I have met are sweet gentle people.  You have to blame the Islamic terrorist for the hatred  you are feeling.  Most Americans don't understand Islam.  Sone think that Islam is responsible for these terror attacks.  It's just ignorance.  I hope that you don't think that all Christians are bad.  I don't think you really do.  We are all human beings.  Some are more closed minded than others.  This is part of life.

However recently supercomputers show the ability to change those programs and thus adapting to the environment such as beating grand chess masters or exploring the Mars surface.

Just kris-cross the subscripts of each element, and add the proper charge in front of the numbers.  Remember, FeCl3 is saying:  Fe1Cl3, so just switch and put on the top the 1 and the 3.  And then add the + or - charge sign.  Iron is always positive, as are all metals (except perhaps hydrides), and chlorine is always -1, as are all of the Group 7  (halogens) elements."
2528767,Q0,2528767_1,1.0,1,'What is the positive or negative sign of the iron atom in FeCl3?',"For any ionic compound, you need to know the charges that certain atoms possess.  For chlorine and all other halogens, the charge is always -1.  . . So, we have two things that we definitely know:. . 1) EACH Cl has a charge of -1.. 2) The net charge of FeCl3 is 0 (since it has no superscript).. . So.... . NET CHARGE = (charge of atom #1)(number of that atom) + (charge of atom #2)(number of atom #2) + .... . And for FeCl3.... . 0 = (charge of Fe)(1 atom) + (-1)(3). . ** charge of Fe = +3.  **. . . . You can see that the net charge of all three chlorines alone give -3.  These chlorines and the Fe3+ give a net charge of 0 for the entire molecule.  . . You can check your work by realizing that Fe3+ only has two charge forms: Fe3+, and Fe2+."

2528767,Q0,2528767_3,1.0,3,'What is the positive or negative sign of the iron atom in FeCl3?',If you imagine a small 1 as the subscript for Fe then you can criss-cross the subscripts and make them superscripts and those will be the charges.

It consists of grains made from semolina that are about 1 mm or 1/16th inch in diameter (after cooking).. . The dish is the primary staple food throughout the Maghreb; in much of Algeria, eastern Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya it is simply known as ta`aam طعام, ""food"". It is popular in the Maghreb, the West African Sahel, in France, in western Sicily's Trapani province, and parts of the Middle East. It is also very popular among Jews of North African descent.. . Couscous was traditionally made from the hard part of the hard wheat Triticum durum, the part of the grain that resisted the grinding of the relatively primitive millstone. The name is also used for prepared dishes made from other grains, such as barley, millet, sorghum, rice, or maize. Couscous is traditionally served under a meat or vegetable stew.. . In the United States couscous is known as a type of pasta, probably reflecting the influence of Sicilian immigrants. However in most other countries it is treated more like a grain in its own right. It is particularly valued for its rapid preparation time.. . In French-speaking countries in sub-Saharan Africa, fufu is often called cous-cous."

However the most plausible evidence points to a North African origin. Indeed, archaeological evidence dating back to the 9th Century and consisting of kitchen utensil needed to prepare this dish was found in this part of the world."

Today we have a war that is being depicted as based on religion so it is important from the stand point that it would be illegal to round up all the Muslims like they did to the Japanese Americans in WW2.. . For Christians I believe it is not good to live where there is religious freedom. I was in Europe during the cold war.  In hungary we had misionaries.  The people there who were christians were like only a few Christians are here today.  They would not have met secretly and had the extremely high moral and oneness were it legal.  There you only became a Christian because you loved God and Jesus,  because doing so was life threatening.   Nobody became a christian to make their business more profitable or because their friends went to church.   Persecution is good for the church so encourage all those atheists."

It was Protestants who invented the Idea of Individual Religious Freedom, as opposed to princes or priests determining the content of our minds..

The right to religious freedom isn't restricted to the Christian religions of our founding fathers. They guaranteed that freedom for everyone, even if they couldn't possibly foresee how far that freedom would reach. There are more people, more nationalities and religions here than ever before, so it's even more important now to safeguard that right.. .

It is important to let people find their own way to enlightenment, without being pressured by the more dominant religions (which happens anyways). And then there is that small little thing we had to go through way back when, that if you disagreed with the ""Church"" you were burned or stoned to death. I think it is important that this does not happen in the US anymore and would like to think that it is because we have matured as a society. You'd think we have grown, but I am skeptical as the same thing happens behind closed doors so that instead of physical harm (most of time because there are always extremists who think they are above the law), mental harm is inflicted. So have we grown, or have we digressed...that is true question behind the supposed freedom of religion declaration."

I wish you luck on keeping your pet, I feel for you.  Truly.. But, I would not get your hopes too high.. Did you make sure your signatures were verifiable?. That may have something to do with them being ignored."

You should be able to prove in court the correct number of valid signatures if you had them.  . . It's not going to reduce dog fighting.  They'll just use boxers or some other breed.  They should probably instead have instated a commissioned ASPCA task force to crack down on dogfighting.  . . If dogfights aren't a problem in your community, there is no reason to ban these animals because they train well, are excellent with children, make terriffic guard dogs, and are one of the more stable breeds mentally/emotionally.  If it's a community concern about attacks, they should ban Dalmations & Chow Chows."

You best read the following legal battle in Denver and all the appeal results. . http://network.bestfriends.org/animallawcoalition/news/postdetail.aspx?gu=animallawcoalition&np=2455. . The problem lies will all those owners who raised dangerous dogs for fighting, and all those pit bull owners who did not realize just how dangerous, even a normally friendly pit bull can be without a strict regimen of obedience training that would prevent the dog from being a menace.. . I am not against pit bulls, I happen to like them. I am against owners who never train their dogs (all breeds) and people who fight their dogs, or raise them to be vicious in order to guard property (i.e., junk yard dog). . . It will take a lot of work to gain public confidence for this beautiful animal.. . P.S. for rvogelpohl2001 and danjelho. The pit bull is no more dangerous than any other dog in initiating an attack. They can however, cause more damage than most dogs once an attack begins. Actually, for initiating an attack, usually for no apparent reason, the toy breeds are the worst. This animal takes a special kind of person for an owner, a person willing to make sure the animal is well trained and socialized. This entire problem is not the fault of the dogs, but of the people and what they have done and not done with these dogs.. . The American Pit Bull Terrier is the breed most people think of as the pit bull. They are in fact, a wonderful dog. I lived with one and I know.. . ""The American Pit Bull Terrier is a good-natured, amusing, extremely loyal and affectionate family pet, which is good with children and adults. Almost always obedient, it is always eager to please its master. It is an extremely courageous and intelligent guard dog that is very full of vitality. Highly protective of his owners and the owner's property, it will fight an enemy to the death. It is usually very friendly, but has an uncanny ability to know when it needs to protect and when everything is okay. The American Pit Bull Terrier can be willful and needs a firm hand. They are generally okay with other pets if they are raised with them from puppy hood.  For the most part they are very friendly, but not recommended for most people. Excellent with children in the family, they have a high pain tolerance and will happily put up with rough child play."" http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.htm"

There are many knowledgable people there and you can learn to help fight anti-dog legislation.. . Suggest and ENFORCE a leash law, that will actually work.. . To the poster who suggested contacting peta - LOL!!!  The 'animal rights' groups are not at all about helping animals, ESPECIALLY peta (who euths 85% of there 'rescues')!  It is about ending all domesticated animals and animal usage including meat/leather.  These groups are PUSHING anti-dog laws while feeding you the phony we love animals crap to get donations.  HSUS, Peta, DDAL, IDA, and many more or NOT animal welfare groups at all, but groups that want to stop you from having any animals at all.. . . BTW, more kids are killed by their PARENTS than PBs every year.  You have a greater chance of getting hit by lightening than killed by a dog.  Maybe parents should be outlawed..... . . Be careful with dangerous dog laws as well.  In my area, my dog would be considered dangerous if she chased a kid on a bike.  If my dog were to get loose and chase a bike (mine wouldn't but many dogs would) they can legally shoot her.  They can also legally shoot her if they *think* she *looks* dangerous.  And how do we know they are qualifyed to make that judgment?  They have to take a beginners obedience class with an already trained dog.  After teaching obedience for 25 years I know how little most people still know after an 8 week session.  I am obsessive about locking my gates for fear of what might happen should they ever get out.  At the very least my show/performance dogs would come back spayed, at most shot dead in the street."

Assuming buckling under this outrageous ban is not an option, and all the Pit Bulls in your city are verified as such, then the outlook is bleak.  You know it's wrong, I know it's wrong, and the people who signed your petition know it's wrong.  . Where I used to live there was also a breed ban against Pit Bulls, but my dog was registered as a ""boxer mix"" by the Humane Society.  There's always the ""Pit Bulls are not a pure breed"" argument, but since Pit Bulls are a pure breed according to the UKC and anyone who owns a Pittie, that's out. . All I can say is, be stubborn like the dogs you are trying to protect.  Petition again, publicly protest, anything legal to tell your city that this is wrong.  Bug those who approved of the ban until they give in, and never give up hope.   God bless you and all the dogs in your city.. .

Mormon is a colloquial term used to refer to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, and most commonly to the movement's original and largest group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The term is derived from The Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith claims to have translated from ancient plates containing a history of the early inhabitants of the Americas that was compiled by a prophet called Mormon. Some mainstream Christian groups consider Mormonism as a cult."
2180086,Q0,2180086_12,1.0,12,'What are men?',Mormons are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
2180086,Q0,2180086_11,1.0,11,'What are men?',"References: Mormon vs Biblical Teachings about Salvation . . . Bible quotations are from the New American Standard version. For information on sources of Mormon quotations, see the section titled ""Mormon Documents"".. . . . 1. Mormons teach that salvation (exaltation) comes through faith in Christ plus baptism plus works, i.e., we must add to the work of Christ. In the Bible 'salvation' means deliverance from the consequence (eternal separation from God) of our sin. Mormon leaders have redefined the word 'salvation' to have a two-fold meaning: a) forgiveness of sins and b) universal resurrection:. . ""There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation"" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, LDS tract, p.5). . ""All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part, meaning they are resurrected"" (Bruce McConkie, What Mormons Think of Christ"", LDS tract, p.28). . Thus, when a Mormon speaks of 'salvation by grace', he is usually referring to universal resurrection. Mormons use the term 'exaltation' to refer to attain a place in the highest level of heaven. The Mormon term 'exaltation' is more nearly equivalent to the Biblical term 'salvation'. What do Mormon leaders say about this?. . The Book of Mormon says of salvation: ""for we know that is is by grace that we are saved, after all that we can do"" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:23). . The LDS Third Article of Faith states: ""We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel"" (Pearl of Great Price: Articles of Faith). . Joseph Fielding Smith explains what that last phrase means: ""that which man merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel"" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, p.134). . James Talmage explains: ""...redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirement of the Gospel, and a life of good works"" (James Talmage, in A Study of the Articles of Faith). . Spencer W. Kimball states: ""however powerful the saving grace of Christ, it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel"" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, pg. 207); ""Each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood; and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world"" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pg. 153); ""living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation...trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin"" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.164-165, 354-355). . Bruce McConkie claimed: ""Jesus kept the commandments of his Father and thereby worked out his own salvation, and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved"" (The Mortal Messiah, Vol.4, p.434). . What works do they mean? Here are some:. . Baptism for the dead: ""The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead...Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at peril of their own salvation"" (Joseph Smith, in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.356, 196). . Marriages sealed in the Temple: ""Marriage is not only a righteous institution, but obedience to this law [Temple marriage] is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the highest exaltation in the Kingdom of God"" (Milton R. Hunter, in Gospel Through the Ages, p.119). . Keeping the whole law: ""To enter the celestial [kingdom] and obtain exaltation, it is necessary that the whole law be kept...Do you desire to enter the celestial Kingdom and receive eternal life? "

It's really unfair and incorrect to suggest that all of the monotheistic faiths have ""caused nothing but harm to everyone in and around it."". . A small example: You probably could kiss modern science goodbye as you know it, if it wasn't for the Christians who believed God had placed intrinsic order in the universe that they could discover. Many of the major scientists 200-300 years ago that started the ball rolling believed in God.. . And many of the men who founded the United States were also firm believers. Some were more ""deistic"" (God exists but is detached from humanity and not entirely personal) in nature, but these are only two major contributions of believers in the faith(s) you're putting down. . . That being said, religion has been abused for centuries, as long as man has had it. Any belief system can be abused, especially one that believes that some things are right and other things are wrong. (And the only systems that can't cause damage are those that have no absolute values to exploit -- so they don't do much anyway.). . And there's a lot of garbage going on in our culture right now, regarding religious people who use religion as a means to  control others rather than serve them. So that's frustrating for everyone. . . But I think that's more a problem with the people, than with the belief system(s)."
849221,Q0,849221_7,0.6666666666666666,7,'Why don't people understand that history often repeats itself?',People who have faith in their religion think there is no wrong in their religion.  They don't see how it can repeat itself although it does anyway.

Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don’t want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a 2 steps process and in order you need to:. 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . . That process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Include small amounts of good fats.. 3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. . The most misunderstood weight loss strategy. How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . Releasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don’t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.. . The reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don’t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t. But wait there is a solution to that…. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . The world most efficient “fat burner” is FREE and You already have it.. . Before I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. . Weight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic “fat burner” that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so effective, why we need a new one. Ther"

This can make quite a difference in the taste.  Also, make sure you are using full fat sour cream, not low fat.  Oddly, I think most restaurants actually use margarine on their potatos instead of butter, which to me tastes more salty than butter.  Try adding a little salt to your potato, too."

I think things taste better when someone else cooks them a lot of times so maybe there is nothing wrong with them.

Certainly, there are a lot of examples of the British media taking time out to explore Islamic culture and to try and portray a more accurate view of lifestyle and culture.. . In the sources below, I post a link to a radio documentary broadcast on BBC last weekend which I believe provides an in-depth and objective view on the topic. It's two hours and has some fluffy stuff before the programme, but well worth listening to.. . However, the media will report news. A group of Arabs sitting in a coffee shop discussing philosophy isn't news and won't get reported.. .  Agroup of muslims taking to the streets of London demanding that a cartoonist be executed for drawing some pictures is news. It also runs against the culture of fairness and free speech that is the core of our democracy - so it is certainly going to portray Islam in a bad light.. . The Western culture has a very different way of undertaking protest. It tends to be non-violent and based around debate. Yet whenever we see Islamic protests they seem to involve threats or actual violence, flag burning and intimidation.. . In the case of the London protests, these were not born out of fruistration at not being able to make a point - these were the first instincts of protest.. . You see, Islam and the Arabs have a real image problem in the West. It isn't just a problem with our media not understanding you - it is just as much about you and your media not attempting to understand us."

Astronauts strap themselves to bike machines and excerize for hours daily when in space to maintain at the same health they'd be if they were on Earth not excercizing at all. If they fail to keep their muscles and bones active, they can experience painful damage to the muscles and even early signs of osteoperosis, the deterioration of bone mass that people on earth experience when they don't have enough calcuim, which can lead to injuring the bone. However, the excercise is easily enough done that maintaining gravity inside spacecraft is not an issue."

143833,Q0,143833_6,1.0,6,'How do you keep your car from freezing in the winter?',"Coolant IS the more proper term.  Ethylene glycol and, more recently propylene glycol do both perform as anti-freeze, but only when the temperature is below 32 degrees F.. . But whenever your engine is up to operating temperature the mixture in the cooling system performs as coolant.  The obvious task is to cool the engine and carry the heat to the radiator.  But another overlooked function of either of the glycols is to help raise the boiling point of the water.  Remember in science class...anything added to water like that will lower freezing point and also raise boiling point as well.  The pressure cap on the radiator keeps the pressure at from 7 to 15 p. s. i. which increases the boiling point as well.  That way all your water will not boil away quickly."

What you want to do is maximize the energy gain, and at the same time minimize the loss. There are several things that you can do. For example:. - Paint the tank black on the outside, so that it will absorb the maximum amount of sunlight. . - Paint the tank silver on the inside, so that it will reflect as much heat as possible as it tries to escape the water.. - Insulate the tank to prevent heat from escaping the water.. - If you have control over the shape, make it as flat as possible, to maximize the surface area, again, to catch as much sunlight as you can.. - If you are willing to spend money on energy, you can heat it with gas, electricity, or both. In this case, heavy insulation on the outside is an absolute must, especially in the middle of winter, or you will lose a lot of cash.... . Hope this helps. Cheers."

2643507,Q0,2643507_13,1.0,13,'Why is milk more expensive than gas?',"Milk costs more, without sales, because of the cost involved in producing packaging, and transporting it. Cows need to be born and raised, given shots and medical care, fed and housed. They produce a limited amount of milk each day. Then the milk gets pasteurized and packaged in individual containers, and has to be transported in a way that keeps it cold the whole time. If it is on the shelf or in transit too long, you won't be able to drink it. Oil on the other hand is already in the ground and is pipelined to a place where it can be pumped into ships, trucks, or barrels. It doesn't need to stay cold and lasts forever. It can be transported without the expense of individual packages. Contrary to what many think today, there are still abundant supplies of it. As the supply decreases, the price will go up to above that of milk. In countries closer to the source, such as Kuwait, gas only costs about 82 cents per gallon, which is less than the cost of water there!"

Killing Zarqawi is the perfect microcosm of the whole war in Iraq.  Heroic soldiers execute with pefection a plan to track down and eliminate Zarqawi.  Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . .

Atomic nuclei are composed of two types of particles, protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. A proton is simply the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom, the lightest atom, and has a unit positive charge. A neutron is an uncharged particle of about the same mass as the proton. The number of protons in a given nucleus is the atomic number of that nucleus and determines which chemical element the nucleus will constitute when surrounded by electrons.. . The total number of protons and neutrons together in a nucleus is the atomic mass number of the nucleus. Two nuclei may have the same atomic number but different mass numbers, thus constituting different forms, or isotopes, of the same element. The mass number of a given isotope is the nearest whole number to the atomic weight of that isotope and is approximately equal to the atomic weight (in the case of carbon-12, exactly equal).. . .

For example, the hydrogen nucleus has a single proton; deuterium has one proton and one neutron and would be called an isotope of hydrogen. (see neutron; proton.), Two nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are said to represent the same element, but different isotopes. For example, helium-3, with two protons and one neutron in each nucleus, and helium-4, with two protons and two neutrons, are two different isotopes of helium. . . nuclide (2 facts) - A species of atomic nucleus, analogous to the word ""isotope"" for a species of atom.

For example, all atoms with one proton are hydrogen, all atoms with two protons are helium, and so on., One of the constituents of the atomic nucleus. It is a spin-1/2 particle carrying positive electric charge. The proton is the lightest baryon and, as a result, is the particle into which all other baryons eventually decay. It is believed to be absolutely stable, but certain theories (GUTs) predict it will decay very, very slowly., A baryon made of two up quarks and a down quark. It possesses a positive electromagnetic charge and can only be found in atomic nuclei.

4311093,U0,4311093_0,1.0,0,'How does hot air go up?',"Because it's less dense. Temperature affects density. And the less dense a gas is, the lighter it becomes, so to speak. Therefore it rises over cold air."
4311093,Q0,4311093_4,0.6666666666666666,4,'How does hot air go up?',lighter than cold air...
4311093,Q0,4311093_9,1.0,9,'How does hot air go up?',"When a volume of air is heated its molecular motion increases and the molecules move further apart thus increasing the volume.. Therefore, there will be less molecules in an equal volume of the hot air than the original volume of cold air.. . The density (weight) of the hotter air will be less than that of the cold air - it therefore rises - convection currents.. . It is this principle that causes a hot air balloon to rise.. . In the atmosphere, the rising air is called a 'Thermal' which is used by gliders, hang-gliders and soaring birds to get the lift.. . This principle is also used in domestic heating where the convection currents circulate the warm air around a room.. . (Convection currents are also set up in liquids)"
4311093,Q0,4311093_8,1.0,8,'How does hot air go up?',"PV=nRT. . as temperature rises - for a constant number of molecules and a constant pressure - the volume increases. A larger volume for the same number of molecules means lower density. Thus a pocket of hot air ""floats"" in the cold air - or rises up."
4311093,Q0,4311093_7,1.0,7,'How does hot air go up?',"It doesn't! . . As my old Physics teacher used to say (usually just after throwing something at us!).... . ""Hot air rises *above cooler air*"". . As has been said, it is because less dense gasses will rise above more dense gasses. So, since warm air is less dense than cold air it will rise above it until it finds air of the same density, at which point it stops rising."
4311093,Q0,4311093_6,1.0,6,'How does hot air go up?',"When air is hot, the heat energy causes the molecules to move further apart and so the density of hot air is lower than that of colder air. the lower density results in it rising up."
4311093,Q0,4311093_5,0.6666666666666666,5,'How does hot air go up?',"Well, let us think of a balloon, as our system.. he gas inside it has a random movement and. is less dense than the air outside our balloon.. . Let it free to move. The balloon flows upward. Why ??. . Well, as you know, the gravity force, acting downward,. results in a force from the bottom to the top, and the. balloon goes up !!  Over the superior face of the balloon. you have a great mass of air, acting upon it. But,. against it, under the inferior face of the balloon there. will act a bigger mass of air, that weights more. The. difference in weights results in a force upward.. And the balloon goes up.. . If there were no gravity force, there will be no forces. acting upon the balloon.. . The same happens with our hotter air surrounded. by the colder air. The random movement of the hotter. air - considered as a system - has no effect upon the. resulting force. And the colder air flows down, to the. place where the hotter air was before ( otherwise. a vacuum will be produced...what impels the colder. air to flow and fill that empty place ). I did not mention. here the action of winds or other atmospheric phenomena. just to make things easier."

An acne scar caused by an increase in tissue formation is a hypertrophic scar and is associated with excessive amounts of collagen.. . Overproduction of collagen is associated with injury to the skin. It is a direct response of the skin to injury. Excessive collagen forms fibrous masses which results in typical acne scar.. . A drug recommended by many dermatologists for the worst cases of acne scars is Accutane. It is the wonder drug of the 21st century to prevent acne scarring in acne sufferers.. . Accutane is a very controversial drug to use as it can cause birth defects. Doctors caution that you should always check whether you're pregnant or liable to be pregnant before commencing a course."

Parents do not KNOW that the child will do the same thing again and they likely HOPE the child will not.  Any form of ""restriction"" is a form of punishment whereby certain privileges or even rights are taken away.  This is a model of how criminals are treated in our (U.S.) society.  Depending on the infraction, more or less privileges are taken away.  It is obviously not the best deterrent but would you rather that parents torture their children into submission every time they commit an infraction?"

The problem with parents today is that they don't talk to their kids enough.  Kids tese days know more at an earlier age thatn we did.  Parents should be open and talk about anything with their kids even if it means hearing something they don't want to.

3552010,E0,3552010_3,0.6666666666666666,3,'Why do parents limit what their kids can do?',how do we know the child will do the same thing over. Plus it depends on the age of the child. If he/she is a small toddler then grounding does no good. You put them in a time out spot or chair for their appropriate age. If they are old like 10 or older. Then yes grounding them or taking things away will have to be the consequences. The child must learn that for every action there is a reaction. It was his/her choice to behave badly. So it is his/her choice to take the responsibility for his actions.
